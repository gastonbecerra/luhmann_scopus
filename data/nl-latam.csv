Arbitrators have the responsibility to solve these conflicts with justice and impartiality. Given the importance of this function, it is necessary to have professionals who have developed their moral capacities to the fullest extent. Unfortunately, various acts of corruption have cast doubt on the moral capacity of some arbitrators and have highlighted the need to investigate the moral development of this population. In this context, the present study aimed to describe and analyze the characteristics of moral reasoning and moral identity of a group of lawyers who devote a good part of their professional work to arbitration. Seventeen lawyers, men and women, who devote more than 50 % of their time to arbitration, participated in this study. The results indicate that, generally speaking, participants reason at a conventional level that makes them prioritize interpersonal expectations and the maintenance of the social system over moral principles. Additionally, the interviewees show different types of identities, some related to social or prosocial issues, but none strictly moral. The results are discussed emphasizing the consequences of low moral reasoning and poor moral identity development, and the need to rethink the moral education of students in law schools. © 2021 Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

To investigate into this matter, this work aims for a reflection about the contingency of communication in social media. Does social media make the experience of communication in the digital space more contingent (providing it with more possibilities, with people accessing different contents and ideas) or less contingent (reducing the available possibilities, making people isolate themselves)? Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical work, constructed through bibliographical reviews. To reflect about the question that are posed, the author selected Niklas Luhmann's social systems theory to approach the concept of contingency. In addition to that, the author presented the main arguments of the debates about echo chambers and online bubbles. In the end, the author combined the two reviews together using elements of the Luhmannian theory and drew some conclusions about the initial question. Findings: The study concluded that social media have an ambivalent potential regarding contingency in the digital space: it can both expand or reduce the available possibilities of communication, depending on criteria like topic, potential of diffusion and focus of attention. There is no one-side effect. Research limitations/implications: The approach at echo chambers does not reflect “the” form of contingency in social media, but “a” form. Therefore, the study cannot provide any general conclusions about the relation between contingency and social media. The digital space is a large one, and more studies are required to achieve more substantial propositions. Originality/value: The research has an originality value both for systems theory and social media studies. First, because, as far as the author knows, no other system-theoretical argument has taken the connection between contingency and social media as a primary analysis object. Second, because of a theoretical interpretation effort, the studies of echo chambers indicate mixed results about the phenomenon of online isolation, but no attempt was made to make sense of these mixed results from a specific sociological theory. The author did that by using Luhmann's theoretical framework, which proved to be a good tool for explaining and unifying these different results on a more abstract level. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Communication; Contingency; Echo chambers; Isolation; Luhmann; Social media; Social system","","E.

Similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, dementia is a challenge for health systems on a global scale. Our hypothesis is that translational potential lies in cross-country learning by involving three high-income countries with distinct geopolitical-cultural-social systems in Latin America (Chile), the South Pacific (New Zealand) and Europe (Germany). Our vision is that such cross-country learning will lead to providing adequate, equitable and sustainable care and support for families living with dementia during a pandemic and beyond. We are proposing a vision for research that takes a multi-disciplinary, strength-based approach at the intersection of health care research, disaster research, global health research and dementia research. We present some insights in support of our hypothesis and proposed research agenda. We anticipate that this research has the potential to contribute towards strengthening and transforming health care systems in times of crises and beyond. © 2021 by the authors.

As a specific objective, this article initially analyzes the feasibility of such a constitutional theory in late modern countries, especially with regard to the application of the ""quality tests"" proposed by social constitutionalism, so that the norms of transnational regimes acquire the constitutional status. In this step, the article points its magnifying glass with emphasis on the indispensability of a dynamic balance in the relations between the internal spheres of the social subsystems (spontaneous and organizational) and the difficulties of this happening in countries of the Global South, which leads to an impossibility of constitutionalization of the self-regulations produced exclusively by the social sectoral regimes in such places. In the end, it is observed whether, in peripheral countries, a minimum state regulation on the self-regulation(mentation) produced by the social subsystems is essential, through which the participation of fundamental rights as tools of balance the internal spheres of the social subsystems (spontaneous and organizational). Methodology: The research has a basic or pure nature, adopts the qualitative-deductive method and uses the bibliographic procedure, with the scope of confirming the hypothesis raised in solving the problem raised. In this sense, the following will be observed: a) the effects of globalization and the systemic hypercomplexity of world society on the traditional idea of liberal-modern constitutionalism and Gunther Teubner's theory of social constitutionalism; b) in this scenario, the paradigm shift in the functions of fundamental rights, which abandon the historical individual-subjectivist bias in favor of an institutional-trans-subjective-collective perspective; c) the consequences that this brings to the effectiveness of fundamental rights on private relationships, especially those at a transnational level; and, finally, d) the impact of the imbalance in the relations between the internal spheres of the social subsystems (spontaneous and organizational) in peripheral countries and the repercussions on the possibility of applying Gunther Teubner's theory of social constitutionalism, especially with regard to the exclusivity in the production of self-regulation(mentations) with constitutional status by the social subsystems themselves. Results: It was found that, in late modern countries, given the imbalance in the relationships between the internal spheres of social subsystems (spontaneous and organizational), there is an extreme difficulty in the direct and pure application of Gunther Teubner's theory of social constitutionalism, especially with regard to the exclusivity of production of self-regulation(mentations) with constitutional status by the social subsystems themselves. In these regions of the planet, the constitutionality of such norms depends on a minimum regulation of the State, through which the participation of fundamental rights as maintainers of balance in the dynamics of those relations is guaranteed. Contributions: In peripheral countries, the constitutionality of norms of their own social regimes (self-regulation(ment) tions) depends on a minimum regulation of the State, through which the participation of fundamental rights is guaranteed as maintainers of balance in the dynamics between the relationships of the areas internal (spontaneous and organizational) of social systems. © 2022 by the Author(s).","fundamental rights; self-regulation regulated; social constitutionalism; theory of social systems; third party effect","","G.F.

In fact, the successive phases that the scholars distinguish about Peirce's approaches to information, roughly match Fisch's periodization of Peirce's philosophical development. In the first phase his approach is restricted to the proposition and the terms that knock it into shape; the forms of inference prevail. In the second phase the concept of information is enriched with the development of Peirce's semiotic theory and his typology of signs. By last, his concept of information receives a more decidedly metaphysical stamp. In this paper we will just expose Peirce's conception of information during the first of these phases, foregrounding his papers Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension (W2 [1867]: 70-86) and Questions on Reality (W2 [1868]: 162-87). Here, individuals explore and actualize possibilities in thought, once they articulate their experience through a social system of signs. That's why, in inferring, ""we ought to say that we are in thought, and not that thoughts are in us"" (EP 1 [1868]: 42). © Associazione Culturale Pragma.

Methodology: The method of approach is systemic; it was used water with quality and potable for human consumption as an operation to understand if they occur irritations between structures of the referred subsystems. It is used as base theory the Social Systems of Niklas Luhmann, in particular the book The Law of Society. Results: The results demonstrated the occurrence structural coupling between the subsystems as to the operationalization of environmental protection and the execution of health actions in regard to the theme water with quality by identifying the irritation of operations, through processes and conditions that seek to guarantee quality for water; by means of processes and conditions seeking to ensure quality of the water; either in the natural space on the use of natural resources or even on those of providing water access service which aim to protect water resources in order to have on management and protection modes of this to have quality for different uses, and, consequently, safety to be served as drinking water for consumption accomplished by the population.

Findings show that, by means of “irritations” originating from other systems, specifically market (economy) and law, the studied organization ended up internalizing environmental sustainability, translating this theme into the economic language of profit and law. The organization’s response, in general, was to differentiate itself internally, with the creation of an organizational subsystem for the environmental management of the organization, which began to pressure other organizational subsystems to internalize this theme – purchasing, people management, production –, generalizing the theme of environmental sustainability. © 2021.

The indirect documentation search technique will be used, with a review of foreign national bibliography, and the qualitative analysis of judicial decisions. Results: as one of the results obtained, the means of the proposed analysis demonstrated how the System of Law plays a fundamental role in the dynamics of social inclusion and exclusion, both in the processes of guarantee of inclusion (access to justice and guarantee of the right to health), and in the legitimation of exclusion processes determined by the State, with a view to compel the citizen to vaccinate (compulsory vaccination), in order to reduce the risks that the contraryness to this act may generate in the Health System. Contributions: the study brings as a contribution, after a comparison between hypotheses of determination or legitimation of inclusion and exclusion by the System of Law, a balance between these decisions with the scope, above all, of highlighting the imprescindibility of a broader social observation for the understanding and resolution of the current problems of constitutional law.

Against this background, it explores the growing environmental conflicts involving water resources in Brazil, including the Amazon region. In addition to the introduction and conclusion, the paper is structured around three topics. The first one outlines how the concept of public security has evolved to the present state, in which climate change is taken into account. Next, climate change is discussed as a factor that magnifies vulnerabilities, an argument supported by a discussion of historical events. The third topic highlights the main threats, vulnerabilities and conflicts involving water resources in Brazil, taking a scientific view of systemic risks and precaution. Finally, we propose rethinking the concept of public security in Brazil from a perspective of parameters involving regulations, principles and state initiative. The article suggests that the immediate and future effects of climate change do have a profound impact on social systems and on the environment, and may be a triggering factor of public insecurity. If institutions and governments do not address existing effects, and invest in adaptations to meet future scientific forecasts on climate change, social stability and the development of a culture of peace will be less likely in Brazil. A fundamental step in this process is the reformulation of the conventional concept of public security in the Brazilian legislation, in order to expressly incorporate the variable of climate security among its stated objectives. In addition, we point out a set of actions and principles with the potentital to promote not only adaptation and resilience, but also contribute to building peace.

This raises questions about power relations between heterogeneous individuals and increasingly dominant and homogenizing system objectives. This article crosses epistemic boundaries by integrating computer engineering and a historicalphilosophical approach making the general organization of individuals within large-scale systems and corresponding individual homogenization intelligible. From a versatile archeological-genealogical perspective, an analysis of computer and social architectures is conducted that reinterprets Foucault’s disciplines and political anatomy to establish the notion of politics for a purely technical system. This permits an understanding of system organization as modern technology with application to technical and social systems alike. Connecting to Heidegger’s notions of the enframing (Gestell) and a more primal truth (anfänglicheren Wahrheit), the recognition of politics in differently developing systems then challenges the immutability of contemporary organization. Following this critique of modernity and within the conceptualization of system organization, Derrida’s democracy to come (à venir) is then reformulated more abstractly as organizations to come. Through the integration of the discussed concepts, the framework of Large-Scale Systems Composed of Homogeneous Individuals (LSSCHI) is proposed, problematizing the relationships between individuals, structure, activity, and power within large-scale systems. The LSSCHI framework highlights the conflict of homogenizing system-level objectives and individual heterogeneity, and outlines power relations and mechanisms of control shared across different social and technical systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","J.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative interpretative study through the theoretical lens of social innovation. The organizational phenomenon studied was the business strategy for sustainable regional development of a Brazilian financial institution. Secondary data were collected from financial institution’s documents. The data analysis followed a categorization technique. Findings: This research presents five intersectional elements that act as agglutinating factors between the structural elements common to these organizations: the processes (inter-organizational and intra-organizational), the forms of materialization of social innovation (products, experiences and replicable forms) and the impacts (in society and organization). Practical implications: The paper contributes to the debate about social innovation as to its definition, showing that it is both a phenomenon and a theory, which is still little explored. In particular, in emerging countries, such as Brazil, which publishes little about social innovation in international literature, going beyond European countries. Second, an empirical deeper understanding of the for-profit “organizations” modus operandi adopts and integrates social innovation in their strategies and operations. Third, given the multidimensional and complex nature of the social systems involved in innovation actions, it discusses a strategy that acts as an agglutinating factor. Finally, with reflections so that managers can discuss and start up a social innovation project. Originality/value: Most research is based on nonempirical evidence. Among the few empirical works, the focus is on the performance of nonprofit organizations in the promotion, development and implementation of projects involving social technology. The literature does not adequately understand how for-profit organizations adopt and integrate social innovation into their strategies and operations. Furthermore, it is observed that research analyzes data from European countries, with few approaches eying countries in development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business impacts; Shared value; Social change; Social innovation; Social technology","","R.G.

This paper examines the state of health of communities affected by flooding occurrences through knowledge and preparedness, health impacts, and emergency response of various state actors during and after flooding incidents. Data were collected through an analysis of different documents, key informant interviews, and focus groups in the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. Results show data from various sources and narratives regarding the degree of preparedness before the flood among community members. During the flooding occurrence, different community damages were mentioned. Due to the destructive nature of floods, community members also stated different health impacts whether immediate, short term, or long term. After the flood, different emergency response and relief were provided. However, citizens and community also cited difficulties about the provision of relief and health care.

This codification process aims to make comparable in time and space the manner in which past societies adapted to floods, and so extract the positive or negative points that can help reduce vulnerability and increase the resilience of current societies. However, the diversity of cultural and historical contexts, as well as the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of documentary sources, makes it difficult to extrapolate quantitative methods in historical climatology. This situation means that interpretative analyses of texts are still necessary as a complement to quantitative studies. In this paper, we make a hermeneutic analysis of the three most catastrophic floods that have occurred in the city of Murcia (south-eastern Spain) in the last 400 years. We complete this analysis with a historical cartographic reconstruction of a quantitative nature. Among the main conclusions, we highlight the fact that the society of Murcia had strategies to overcome catastrophes that included the whole of society and an integrated emergency management. However, the state of poverty of privation prior to a flood is a determining factor in explaining the resilience of a social system. A large increase in exposure of flood-prone areas over the past two centuries is noteworthy but unsurprising. However, it is surprising that the percentage of urban area exposed to flooding is now smaller than in the past. Therefore, if we consider hazard avoidance as a form of management, we can say that pre-industrial Murcian society was less efficient in using the mechanisms available to adapt to flooding. © 2021, The authors.","Catastrophic floods; Hermeneutic analysis; Historical cartography; Huerta of Murcia; Vulnerability","","S.

Yet conflicts over wolves tend to persist in practice. Based on Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory, we aim to explain this persistence by considering conflicts over wolves as evolving unities of persisting and contradicting communications. Using a case study in Redes Natural Park, Spain, we illustrate how conflicts over wolves evolve semi-independently through internal and external communications. These communications can both fuel and redirect the complex trajectories of conflict, thereby contributing to its persistence over time. Taking lessons from this case, we propose alternative interventions that do not necessarily aim at resolving conflicts, but instead consider an open-mindedness toward the multitude of conflict observations and experiences; the need to follow and monitor the enduring lives of conflict over wolves; and the prudence of overly managing these conflicts at a distance. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","co-existence; communications; Human-wolf conflict; Luhmann; social systems theory","Spain; Canidae; Varanidae; canid; coexistence; communication; conflict management; nature-society relations; park management; social theory","","","Routledge","08941920","","","","English","Soc.

These guidelines are briefly illustrated with reference to a case study: the productive cultural landscape of wine and vineyards in the riverside city of Salto, Uruguay, during the last years of the 19th century. The proposed guidelines follow the order and approaches of the links in the Landscape Value Chain. These steps are applied to the landscape from a triple approach, as memory, image and socio-system. Thus, the identification of traces and narratives of memory, elements of image and poles of opportunity of the socio-system is proposed. Each element is valued, considering its potential for re-signification and its cost. An intervention is also proposed, based on reversibility and humility. And, at all times, a process of dissemination or accountability and socialization or social dialogue is maintained. In conclusion, the recovery of a landscape must be understood as something that implies re-signifying its memory (activating its traces with narratives), the restoration of its image (giving it continuity) and restoring its social system (reactivating the socioeconomic dynamics based on the feeling of belonging), through an adequate social participation and a required subjective, non-positivistic approach to the processes, to achieve our objective: the recovery of the character of a productive cultural landscape to encourage the entrepreneurship of its inhabitants. © 2020 WITPress.

Secondly, a qualitative study evaluates the life course of 36 individuals involved in a European binational relationship. Both interactions within and outside Europe are assessed. The findings show that three types of interactions might promote a strong identification as European: Intra-European integrative interactions, involving a certain level of integration into the host society (in economic, educational and social systems) and associated with long-term stays; Multicultural interactions, involving a setting of shared activities and cooperation between individuals of several European nationalities; and Outside Europe interactions, that put Europe at perspective between the “we” and the “others”.

Its meaning, however, remains an object of avid discussion due to the impossibility of finding a precise and timeless way of defining the concept. In this article, we argue that acknowledging inherence as an element of human dignity gives extrinsic legal recognition to an intrinsic human condition and tends to expand human dignity's influence. Vagueness - or openness - in defining the concept provides for a dynamic and evolutionary understanding of human dignity, and, coupled with the idea of inherence, these characteristics represent tools for universalization and adaptation of the concept to new circumstances. These findings are based on a review of philosophical discussions of the idea of human dignity, followed by an analysis of how it is addressed in international legal instruments and international jurisprudence and identification of its recurrent elements. We defend the view that the vagueness of its definition does not mean that its content is impossible to identify in particular circumstances. Scholars and institutions can have a concrete sense of the meaning of human dignity even though its substance may admit new elements as new social demands emerge. In our view, the essential meaning of human dignity is founded on the influence of the whole body of human rights as well as on its particular connection to the rights of social minorities, in which human dignity is emphasized because of the material precariousness of such groups under social systems that subject them to discriminatory treatment.  © ","human dignity; human rights; inherence; international human rights law; international legal order; protection of social minorities; universalization; vagueness","","","","Cambridge University Press","00690058","","","","English","Can.

These relationships are established via conceptual communications which form networks that establish the way in which disciplined are organized. At present, the big data phenomena offers the capacity to use large data collections to analyse social processes. Big scholarly data sources offer sociology immense quantities of data useful to describe and study the evolution of scientific disciplines in detail. In this article we characterised the last thirty years of sociology through its publications in impact factor journals. To do this, we use data about the sociology journals from Journal Citation reports augmented with article information from Microsoft Academic Graph. The analysis starts by describing the journals, countries of origin, languages, publishers, the decades in which they appeared and their impact factor. After this, we evaluate the evolution of numbers of articles and citations as well as co-authorship and gender proportion. Subsequently, we establish four groups of journal types and study their differences in the previous dimensions using hypothesis tests. Finally, we represent the relationships between authors and journals using an affiliation network that allows us to detect groups of journals that form interesting thematic and geographic communities. The novelty of the work consists in having used a data source of the so-called big scholarly data with more than 300 million publications. The paper also provides several strategies to select the data of interest among the millions of publications to reduce their dimensionality in order to represent them in the form of a network. The results show a discipline dominated by Anglo-Saxon countries and large publishing conglomerates. The most prominent journals dominate citations whilst methodological journals have a higher degree of co-authorship and thematic journals have the lowest gender bias. The affiliation network between authors and journals contains two large groups, one formed by the pioneering American journals together with quantitative methodological journals and another one made up of English and qualitative methodological journals. © 2022 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

We focus on the role of the students’ local and immigrant families in this often-challenging process. We have evidence of the vital role of families in children and youth education. However, research mainly focuses on teachers when discussing issues related to the reception and inclusion of migrant students in schools, often forgetting that families and children/youth are also critical elements in these processes. In this project, we have explored the roles expected and developed by local and foreign families in facilitating and accompanying schools and students on these not-always-easy paths using various methods and activities. This paper focuses on aspects of the MiCREATE project related to the crucial role of families in their children’s social and educational experiences in the host country. It is based on fieldwork carried out in 16 schools in Spain, including teachers, families, students, educational community members and policymakers. Art-based research methods, open-ended interviews and focus groups provided a broad picture of the different views and expectations of all those involved in formal education. From the thematic analysis of the participants’ contributions, results emerge around two main focuses: (1) difficulties migrant families face in getting involved in school life, such as cultural clashes, school segregation, migrant families’ environment and the difference between primary school and secondary schools; (2) more general and specific initiatives that facilitate migrant family involvement in school life.

In this research we explored dates of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The corpora were made up of data catalogued on institutional websites, documents obtained from directors of associations and unions of sex workers, in addition to e-mail exchanges and online conversations with directors and sex professionals via virtual meetings. In the area of political communications, we observe inclusions and exclusions at the same time, as regulation has promoted several exclusions. The participation of workers in the discussions, when that had happened, was not reflected a posteriori either in public policies or in the implementation of regulations. As for legal communications, we observe that those who practice the profession experience inclusions and exclusions at the same time, since the profession is criminalized at the same time that it is recognized as a profession. The conclusion is that the inclusion/exclusion form broadens the spectrum of observation by allowing inclusion to be observed at the same time as exclusion. © 2021, Onati International Institute for the Sociology of Law.

The objective of this investigation, avoiding digging into the reasons for these claims, is to identify whether the region of residence influences the legitimacy of the Spanish state. The legitimacy of the state is the degree of citizen’s support to the institutions. This support ensures the law compliance, the proper functioning of the country and citizen commitment with the social system. State’s legitimacy is very much linked with the trust on politics and politicians. In the regions characterized by independency issues and conflicts, state’s legitimacy will be limited, and the perception of the state’s meaning and power will be more fragile and instable. The effective and appropriate management of the state and the relevancy of the central politics would be complex in these regions and, finally, regional inequality and fragmentation will increase. To achieve this research objective, we carried out an analysis of the state’s legitimacy of each Spanish region considering the data extracted from the European Social Survey. The results of this research provide valuable information useful for regional political decision making and dig into the reasons why regional conflicts are rooted in the state’s institutions. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","legitimacy; regionalism; Spain; states; trust","article; decision making; human; perception; politics; public figure; Spain; trust","A.

In this paper, an innovation and technology transfer project was laid out. The project was promoted by the Institute of Agricultural and Fisheries Research and Training (IFAPA), belonging to the Regional Government of Andalusia. The main objective of the project was to contribute to the sustainability of the complex ecological, productive, and social system of this region. The project was focused on the rational use of water resources. Experimentation, demonstration, technology transfer, and training activities were carried out, involving public administrations, companies, and private farms. The project was carried out in collaboration with strawberry companies covering a total surface area of 1900 hectares. Irrigation application efficiency and irrigation water productivity increased by 66% and there was also a significant increase in water saving (44%), without resulting production losses. The success of the activity was based on the implication of farmers in experimentation assignments. During a five-year time span, irrigation trials took place on several farms. This fact allowed a progressive improvement of irrigation management by farmers based on confidence in the experimental work results. © 2021 by the authors.

In this sense, the biorefineries platforms are a strategic factor to increase the bioeconomy in the economic balance. The incorporation of renewable sources to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, includes sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), and creating more manufacturing jobs fostering the advancement of regional and social systems by implementing the comprehensive use of available biomass, due to its low costs and high availability. This paper describes the emerging biorefinery strategies to produce fuels (bio-ethanol and γ-valerolactone) and energy (pellets and steam), compared with the currently established biorefineries designed for fuels, pellets, and steam. The focus is on the state of the art of biofuels and energy production and environmental factors, as well as a discussion about the main conversion technologies, production strategies, and barriers. Through the implementation of biorefineries platforms and the evaluation of low environmental impact technologies and processes, new sustainable production strategies for biofuels and energy can be established, making these biobased industries into more competitive alternatives, and improving the economy of the current value chains. © 2021 by the authors.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Biomass; Lignocellulosic wastes; Sustainable feedstocks","biofuel; economic conditions; environmental factor; renewable resource; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development","M.C.

Among scales of attention and shared responsibilities, companies are also in the radar of and interested in to be more sustainable. An efficient way in disclosing information on companies’ sustainability is through sustainability reports, such as the global reporting initiative (GRI) framework. Although recognized as an important alternative, the GRI is receiving criticisms about its ability in accurately express the meaning of sustainability. This work applies the paraconsistent annotated evidential logic (PAEL) on opinions of experts in the sustainability theme to verify whether the GRI indicators are aligned to the concept of ‘strong’ sustainability. A survey applied to twenty-two experts from different field areas, backgrounds and work experiences on sustainability-related issues provided their beliefs and disbeliefs, in a quantitative way, about the ability of each of the 91 GRI indicators in expressing sustainability. Results show high dispersion (coefficient of variation >30%) among the experts opinions for 77 of the GRI indicators, in which the social category appears with the worst performance with its total 48 indicators with high dispersion. This is an indicative of different understandings by experts about the meaning of sustainability concept and/or the meaning and reach of GRI indicators in achieving sustainability. The PAEL reports that all three categories (economic, environmental and social) fall into the ‘paracomplete’ region of the Cartesian unitary square’s graph, indicating an inconclusive result about whether these three categories are able to capture and/or express the concept of strong sustainability. The overall performance (barycenter with beliefs of μ = 0.26 and disbeliefs of » = 0.17) also fall into the paracomplete region, rejecting the initial hypothesis that GRI may show strong sustainability. Recognizing the increasing importance of sustainability reports, this work contributes in identifying and suggesting improvements to the GRI developers on indicators that may better represent the strong sustainability and achieve its main goals. GRI’s framework should be based on a clear sustainability model and provide through a simple, fast and understandable way, information about the purposes of each indicator. Focus for improvements should be especially directed to: EC4-6; EN18, 20, 21 and 34; LA2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14; SO3-8, 11; PR1-5, 7-9; HR3, 8-10. © 2021. L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

Methodology: The methodology used is systemic-constructivist, based on the contributions of Niklas Luhmann, which allows to examine how each system perceives the pesticide glyphosate. Regarding procedural techniques, systematic literature review, bibliographic, documentary and jurisprudential research were performed. Results: The science system, by proving a correlation between glyphosate and human health damages, led society to movements ranging from the ban on pesticides in some countries to to billionaire compensation to victims brought by the legal system. However, there is a long way for the effective banishment of the most consumed pesticide in the world. Contributions: This study examined data from the science system (scientific research), the political system (national and international regulatory agencies) and the legal system (actions and decisions in the judicial sphere). In doing so, it offers a reflection on the process of self-confrontation of the society with the risks it created when launching products, such as glyphosate, without sufficient research to indicate its safe use. © Copyright 2021: Publication Service of the University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.","Future Damages; Glyphosate; Health Risks; Pesticides; Reflective Modernization","","J.J.

Demonstrate that any attempt to correct deviations from a hypothetical trajectory whose ultimate goal is the utopia, increasingly demands more work, including measures that lead to terror, which may even be absolute, leading to the horrible paradox that in seeking paradise hell is constructed. Design/methodology/approach: Scientific tools that the authors have used are: the theory of the system linkage, alysidal algebra, kinematic theory and vector analysis. Findings: Myths are the substrate of some complex systems of beliefs and utopia is its ultimate goal. The use of the combination of the theory of trajectories, belonging to the alysidal algebra, the theorem of unintended effects and kinematics theory provides an approximation to deviations suffering utopian ideological currents and their corrections. Originality/value: This paper is a continuation of other previous papers developing the theory of complex societies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alysidal sets; Dystopia; Forces; Gnorpsic functions; Responses; Social systems; Totalitarianism; Trajectory; Unintended effects; Utopia","Algebra; Design/methodology/approach; Kinematic Theory; Scientific tool; Vector analysis; Kinematics","J.L.

Different legal systems decide whom they trust as translators; institutional employers carry out their own exams; education systems provide signals of competence; the systems of controlled knowledge (science) and its diffusion (news) tend to rely on their own members who ‘know languages’ and, as has been seen in the case of pandemic-related information, rarely display constant trust in wholly independent interpreters. Analysis of interpreters’ trustworthiness in terms of Luhmann’s sociology can thus start from dependencies between at least four possible types of system: interpreters supply utterance; legal systems assume truthful utterance; education systems attest the relative trustworthiness of utterance; systems of knowledge control and diffusion (science, the military, government information, news) assume shared skills or ad hoc modes of professional hybridity. On this view, an interpreter system is only sometimes able to create its own signals of trustworthiness and have those signals accepted. In many instances, it must rely on intersystemic relations, which are often irritations ensuing from the way one social system is given to not understanding another. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Interpreting; Luhmann; systems theory; trust","","A.

The results of these analyses demonstrate the difficulty of regulating fake news in Brazil and the problems with a legal framework based on the deference of the Judiciary to legislative decisions; its openness to technology experts; and the adoption of “regulated self-regulation” as a way of building an interface between legal and political national systems and transnational digital platforms. © The Author(s) 2022.","digital media; elections; fake news; regulation; social systems theory","","M.A. Loschiavo Leme de Barros; Law School of Mackenzie Presbyterian University, Brazil; email: marcoloschiavo@gmail.com","","SAGE Publications Ltd","09646639","","","","English","Soc.

Or are crisis, a set of nonlinear events with somewhat a chaotic nature, better represented as multilayer relapse cycles, that is, a series of dynamic processes and templates that evolve at different levels of analysis and can either go forward—achievement—or go back—relapses? Moreover, should crisis always move forward to reach their resolution or should we strive to achieve social systems resilience, grounded on learning and adaptation processes, that is, moving forward and backwards, until achieving it? To argument in favor of achieving crisis resilience, we propose a theoretical model—the crisis layers and thresholds (CLT) model grounded on the following assumptions: (a) individuals' evaluations and responses should be the basis/core of crisis management and crisis communication activities; (b) different concurrent psychosocial and organizational processes occur at different levels of analysis of a crisis, from a microindividual level to a macro organization level; and (c) rather than striving for crisis resolution, we should strive for crisis resilience, preparing the social system for current and future emerging risks and crisis. To implement effective evidence-based crisis management and crisis communication in line with such assumptions, we also propose the CLT-ResiliScence approach, an Information and Communication Technology-mediated crisis sensing approach. This is based on monitoring “social sensors” data, particularly from social media, as an important source of information.

This implies considering happiness as part of the social sphere and incorporating social dimensions and aspects to understand the social system in which it is immersed. For this we use the World Values Survey (WVS) which collects information on a wide range of social orientations and actions. And for the reconstruction of the social field of happiness, we conceptually transform causal interrelationships between a set of variables, among which happiness is found, into a system of directed relationships between nodes that we analyze and visualize with the instruments of Social Network Analysis. The combination of conventional statistical analysis with network analysis brings us closer to the complexity of the interacting factors in the social field of happiness and brings us closer to a social map of happiness. And in that map we can identify social roads as combinations of meanings and practices. © 2022, Fundacion Sistema. All rights reserved.","happiness; socialmap; socialnetworks","","J.A.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is qualitative/interpretive and uses of the concept of functional homomorphism of WR Ashby is used, establishing similarities between the way in which this ancient medicine considers the human being and their condition as healthy to transfer it to an organization that produces goods and/or services. Findings: A healthy organization is conceived as one constituted by an association of people regulated by a set of norms based on certain purposes in a state of harmonious balance of their physical and energetic dimensions. In that the physical refers to storage functions, regulation and allocation of resources; transformation of raw materials and inputs into goods and services; waste disposal, distribution and coordination and with information systems for management control, while energy is associated with the ability to act with its management and policies. Research limitations/implications: The current paper is a first theoretical proposal, which should be enriched with practical applications that feedback its conceptual formulation, thus contributing to its validation. Practical implications: A comprehensive organizational diagnostic method is made available.

Some rules are applied, and some are not, depending on certain actors, such as the State, the stakeholders, or others. This undermines legitimation as constructed by legality and due process. These problems are connected to a wider complex formed by coloniality, internal colonialism, and a form of functional differentiation that limits autonomy of the different social systems. This complex of structural properties allows States and other actors to systematically use one system against the other or—within a given system—one level of rules against the other. This was the case in Ecuador: in the initial months of quarantine due to Covid-19, the government took decisions about external state bonds following international legislation—and quite contrary ones related to local work contracts. Once again, legality followed different paths in diverse cases. Ecuadorian economic authorities accept and respect conditions on external public bonds which are protected by some complex and specific clauses to secure the payment. The same authorities have different practices towards international and national legislation that were organized in the sense of legal subsidiarity. This text will explore reasons and effects of legal de-differentiation in the Global South in times of crisis. The Ecuadorian case in time of Covid-19 helps to understand how structural problems related to the lack of autonomy of the legal system are perpetuated and lead to effects of convenient political action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","De-differentiation; Ecuador; External state bonds; Lack of autonomy; Legality; Local contracts","","K.

However, they are not usually observed, but rather assumed as self-evident and necessarily “good.” The purpose of the article is to summarize the theory of morality from the social systems' perspective and illustrate with concrete examples the polemogenous nature of moral communication. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents an analysis of the role of morality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory. Applying the method of second-order observation, it describes three cases of moral semantics disseminated via mass media and social media, and it examines their connection with the structural situation of subsystems of society during the pandemic crisis (particularly healthcare, politics and science). Findings: Second-order observation of moral communication demonstrates to be fruitful to describe the conditions and consequences in which moralization of communication occurs, particularly in a situation of critical transition around the healthcare crisis. The three examples examined, namely, the hero semantics directed to healthcare workers, the semantics of indiscipline and the controversies around pseudo-sciences and conspiracy theories, show how they are based on social attribution of esteem and disesteem, how they try to answer to troublesome situations and contradictions that seem difficult to cope, and how they are close related to the emergence of conflicts, even when they seem positive oriented and well intentioned. Originality/value: This paper is an attempt to test the usefulness of Luhmann's theory of society to understand the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and particularly the role of moral communication in concrete examples. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Semantics; Social systems; Systems theory","Concretes; Health care; Design/methodology/approach; Healthcare workers; Mass media; Second orders; Social media; Social systems; Semantics","F.X.

In particular, we focus on the structural aspects of the complexity exhibited by social systems organized into low- and intermediate-level functional units (i.e., groups and teams). To address this subject, we describe a methodology suited for measuring the complexity in the organization of work in such systems, which is primarily based on hierarchical task analysis. With this methodology, we approach a concrete case study: the construction of megalithic monuments in late prehistoric Iberia (ca. 3800–1800 BC). On the basis of the analysis of the three best documented, most structurally, and functionally complex monuments built within each of the three periods under study (Late Neolithic, Copper Age, and Early Bronze Age), we found that there was a trend towards less complexity in work organization related to monument building from the Late Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. We discuss the importance of these results in light of the existing models of social complexity in European Later Prehistory, concluding that a more balanced view of social processes would be obtained if we look at complexity as a property of every different social system integrated into the whole society, and not as an exclusive property of the latter. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Iberian Late Prehistory; Megalithic monuments; Social systems; Structural and functional complexity; Task analysis; Work organization","","G.

A dialogue between them may offer new insights on the complex articulation of the nature and society nexus in socio-environmental transformations. By means of the conceptual reconstruction of both theories and drawing on relevant literature of social-ecological research, in this article, I argue that systems theory can contribute to the theory of critical transitions with a robust concept of communication that accounts for the relevance of semantics and social structures, the production of communicative locks, and the identification of early warning signals of social-ecological transitions in communication. On the other hand, the theory of critical transitions provides systems theory with both a refined concept of crisis as critical transition and the technical tools for empirical research. The article concludes that the dialogue between the science of ecosystems and the science of society is not an intellectual exercise but a form of increasing the correspondence between social-ecological transitions and our explanations and interventions in this domain.

Public goods occur in greater abundance in cities with more cooperative and inclusive forms of organization, which seems to undermine arguments that elites constructed them to augment their power. Such goods are major “pull” factors drawing migration to modern cities, but ancient cities also had public goods that likely attracted immigrants, increasing their population and diversity. We examine these ideas at Middle Preclassic-period (cal 800–300 BC) Nixtun-Ch'ich', in Petén, Guatemala. This city and other Preclassic metropoles in the Maya lowlands seem to have been on the more-cooperative end of a cooperative–competitive spectrum, compared to most cities of the Classic period (AD 200–900). We also speculate about how symbolic public goods were coopted to create a more exclusive social system in the Late Preclassic period (300 BC–AD 200).

These changes come together with new communication strategies on social media that have had quite an impact on society and traditional media. These strategies appeal to emotional mobilization by means of the concept of climate emergency. The aim of this paper is the analysis of the communicative dimension of FfF: its discursive frames and its use of social media. A mixed methodology (ethnographic fieldwork and social media analysis –Twitter-) was used. The results reflect three aspects of its discourses that stand out from what is collected in the literature on previous ecological frameworks: the emphasis on climate emergency vs. sustainability, the move from individual ecological behaviours to social system transformation, and, finally, radical egalitarianism. Twitter is used mainly for information of mobilization resorting to frames of systemic change and climate emergency. However, the impact of these messages is lower to the one that ecological denunciation or dissemination messages get. These last kinds of tweets resort more frequently to frames of ecosocial justice, climate change and future at risk. © 2022 Authors.

Focusing on his early Social Theory, I sustain that Simmel offers an approach to the issues of the division of labour and the social integration alternative of that of Émile Durkheim. Thus, I argue that the German thinker´s proposal is not multidimensional just because it conceives differentiation in parallel to the “equalization”, but also to the extent that it deals with the constitution of individuality alongside that of the modern groups, the point at which he anticipates some aspects of Niklas Luhmann´s Differentiation Theory. In this frame I display the other dimensions that Simmel outlines to unravel the modern process of differentiation, that is, the contrast between “subjective” and “objective”, “qualitative” and “quantitative”, “synchronic” and “diachronic differentiation”. © Lionel Lewkow, 2021.","Classical sociology; Georg Simmel; Individualisation; Niklas Luhmann; Social differentiation; Émile Durkheim","","L.

This research article describes the institutional changes, and how these generate organizational changes in companies in the Colombian oil sector, studying at the same time how these changes configure practices of corporate social responsibility. From a review of the bibliography and the study of eight representative cases of the sector, different perspectives of authors are reviewed. The results indicate that the companies studied are under strict institutional and regulatory control, especially at the international level, since most of these companies have capital abroad and, for this reason, they must operate under the strict guidelines of this law. level. It is concluded that the oil sector defines its processes of corporate social responsibility as a competitive strategy and adaptability to institutional changes, orienting itself today to the sustainability of companies. Corporate Social Responsibility is an important component of the corporate strategy that seeks to mediate between the different actors of the social system and the internal forms of organization. © 2022, Revista de Ciencias Sociales.

However, it needs processes that reactivate it in the social sphere from studies that glimpse a symbiotic relationship, library-user. A particular case refers to the Zenon Solano Ricaurte Public Library in Duitama, an educational space that, since its recognition as a public entity in 1997, was intended to serve as a recreational tool in the teaching-learning processes. However, and beyond the obvious problems it presents, the public library has gone through a series of transformations as a door to free access to knowledge, as a repository of past ideas for present and future generations, and as a promoter of new cultural alternatives for the entertainment and permanence of its users, thus promoting a kind of resistance to encourage its use and keep it from falling into oblivion. This research with a hermeneutic approach, and descriptive scope, collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups the social imaginary built by the user around his or her relationship with the library in question. An imaginary that contributed to the understanding of this space from the individual and collective dimension of the practices of use that surround: the first, by aiming at the consolidation of the self in terms of the resignification of identity based on the affective bond with the library as a space that is travelled, visited, inhabited; and the second, as part of the improvement of interpersonal relations and collaborative dynamics between users of the place. In this way, the proposed reflections have been given from the perceptive processes that configure it not from its historicity but from its symbolic validity as a territory that promotes cultural practices. In the same way, it conceives the citizen as a social being who cohabits with the environment in search of achieving his personal development objectives. © 2021.

It is based on another hypothesis that postulates that boredom can become a political emotion capable of unleashing a revolution when it affects an entire community. The main objective of the work is to explain the theoretical, philosophical framework in which the second hypothesis is inscribed and to give reasons why, if this is true, it could be applied to the specific case of Chile. In this sense, an unpublished definition of the concept of boredom is first outlined and the literature that describes boredom as a reactive and political emotion is examined. Then, the Chilean socio-political context of the last forty years is analyzed in search of isolatable factors that may be related to the experience of boredom. Lastly, an original line of research is proposed on which to work to test both hypotheses in a broader project that aims to be able to predict when a social system is on the verge of collapse because of boredom.

The recognition of a social system requires the identification of its operational closure, which allows its autonomous operation without environmental interference. In this context, law is seen as a functionally differentiated system among social subsystems, regarding its task of stabilizing normative expectations. Law reproduces itself autonomously by means of texts, and it is a challenge for its institutions to maintain its autonomy when interpreting and applying the texts. To maintain this autonomous function, law motivates and is motivated by trust. Trust demands the anticipation of the future (and of legal decisions), which ends up guiding the interpretation and application of law and the maintenance of its social specialization. © 2021.

Methodology: According to an appropriate methodology to deal with specific interdisciplinary themes, such as Tax Law, Financial Law, Constitutional Law and Public Management, it is from a critical view of the exposed reality, taking as a theoretical framework the contemporary doctrine referred to, when adopting the deductive method, with the support of bibliographic and documentary exploration as an approach technique to prove the premises raised and to achieve the proposed objectives. Results: Under such a context, the paper identifies the forms adopted, in the occasion of the pandemic by COVID-19 by the federal government to obtain a balance between the economic system and the social order, that is, in order to have, on the one hand, the preservation of the health system (public and private) from an immediate collapse in view of an abrupt excess of demand and, on the other hand, the protection of the national productive forces of the recession and public indebtedness caused by the forced paralysis of economic activities and social isolation/distancing imposed by quarantine. Contributions: This paper notes, according to the adopted methodology, the need for a simultaneous and correlated state intervention of macroprudential regulation in the economic domain (with financial, tax and assistance determinations) for a rebalancing in sustainable development due to the lack of harmony arising from the intervention in the social system with the imposition of such austere sanitary measures (of social isolation/distancing and paralysis of economic activities in quarantine) to contain the pandemic that would remove recession and uncontrolled public indebtedness, in order to have, in conclusion, a sustainable state strategic planning for national developmental recovery and restructuring in light of a democratic concert with society. © 2021, Centro Universitário Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

However, serious doubts were raised on the possibility that Luhmann’s theory of society could be disconnnected from his Eurocentric point of view. This study proposes, in general terms, a path to overcome such a deadlock in systemic theory. The example posed by the case of Latin America case should be taken into account to, initially, distance Luhmann’s theory from its Eurocentric perspective with regard to world society, and later, to correct his narrative of functional differentiation as a resulting phenomenon from transformation processes and social evolution which are internal to Europe. This correction consists of considering hierarchical and supranational structures of colonialism to be constitutive parts of the formation process of a functionally differentiated world society. © 2021, Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ.

This study aimed to determine pre-service science teachers’ level of ecological knowledge in Cebu City, Central Visayas, Philippines, and their relationship to their senior high school (SHS) strand. A validated 40-item multiple-choice Ecological Knowledge Test (Cronbach’s α = 0.759) was administered to 66 pre-service science teachers selected through convenience sampling. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, one-sample t-test, analysis of variance, path analysis, and non-parametric correlation tested at a 95% confidence level. The study results revealed that the pre-service teachers had “Above Average” knowledge of ecology and its major, related, and other concepts. These concepts did not have significant differences among them but showed a significant effect on ecological knowledge. SHS strand did not show significant association with the said knowledge. Therefore, the pre-service science teachers were ecologically and environmentally literate. To increase ecological knowledge continually, they should be exposed to ecological and environmental immersion to gain awareness and knowledge and develop an in-depth appreciation for the ecosystems. © 2021 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

In our opinion, this transfer can contribute to a theory of social evolution where the relation between individual actions and social structures is a focal point. Central to the argument is the idea that dissipative structures emerge in social systems like they do in other open systems with inflows triggered by constraints. The transfer delivers a complexity-informed model for the different phases of social evolution. While there are average periods where the prevailing ‘norms’ of social behaviour do not change in a significant way, there are also bifurcation periods where the ‘norm’ of behaviour may change due to the amplification of deviating individual behaviour. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","dissipative structure; part–whole; social complexity; social evolution; spontaneous order","Behavioral research; Systems science; Average period; Dissipative structure; Dissipative structure theories; Individual behaviour; Social behavior; Social behaviour; Social evolution; Social structure; Thermodynamics","T.

The starting point for establishing this relationship is the distinction between communication and conversation as pointed out by authors such as Gordon Pask, Ranulph Glanville and Vilém Flusser. Alchemy was the field of knowledge that best managed to unify Europe’s technological, philosophical and mystical world-view in the late Middle Ages. From an experimental basis, alchemy dealt with the transformation processes mirrored both in a particular understanding of the dynamics of nature as in the connection between man and universe. Cybernetics, like alchemy, was a field developed from an interdisciplinary view of knowledge associated with a particular historical context, being, since its origin, the field that relates and operationalizes complexity and unpredictability in mechanical, biological and social systems. Cybernetics and alchemy are, from a constructivist perspective, models for structuring the world and collective systems of communication within cultural processes. Both are taken here as co-participants in an elliptical dialogue based on three main concepts: distinction, dialogue and emergence. The elliptical conversation model can be understood as a map of the complexity of the interactive field that is established between alchemy and cybernetics, generating a new entity while encapsulating two others, it is the distinction that accommodates two others, a dialogue between black boxes. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.","alchemy; conversation; cybernetics; dialogue; distinction; emergence","","D.F. da Silva; Escola de Arquitetura da UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Rua Paraíba, 697, MG, Brazil; email: diego@nimbu.com.br","","Intellect Ltd.","1477965X","","","","English","Technoetic Arts","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133198299"

This fosters the need to develop interdisciplinary approaches to urban issues by combining natural and social sciences. Cities, as the predominant mode of social organization, are vulnerable to social and environmental challenges which urban green spaces (UGS) can contribute to solve by the ecosystem services (ES) that can provide. The objective was to assess the quality of UGS framed by the ES classification and relate with the provision of these services in areas of distinct socioeconomic and environmental deprivation. An evaluation grid was applied in 25 UGS in the city of Porto. Socioeconomic and environmental deprivation index applied by the Porto City Hall in the Municipal Master plan to divide the city into 5 clusters of deprivation was used to select 5 UGS of each cluster. In the most deprived communities, namely in clusters of high and very high socioeconomic and environmental deprivation, the quality of UGS is lower than in the less vulnerable ones. Besides this, it was found that some UGS located in clusters with higher vulnerability have an overall good quality, namely those located in historic and touristic areas of the city. The evaluation grid may be useful to the local authorities to diagnose, monitor and evaluate the ES of UGS and to identify situations of environmental injustice contributing to pursue the implementation of sustainable development goals at a local level. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","inequalities; socioeconomic inequity; Sustainable development; urban ecosystem services; urban planning","Porto [Portugal]; Portugal; Varanidae; environmental justice; greenspace; interdisciplinary approach; socioeconomic survey; spatial analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; tourism; urban area; vulnerability","D.G.

Considering some complex and stressful police environments (eg, searches, arrests of criminals, brawls), the criminal investigator is required to be able to manage the unpredictability and associated risk, and to decide quickly from the selection and treatment of situational information, only possible if there are organizationally high levels of training and frequent training, with a focus on simulator shooting exercises because they are closer to reality. The police decision-making process is, for the reasons invoked, complex and conditioned by psychophysiological, environmental and task variables (Davies, 2015).

To gather such evidence, we proposed a index of social perceptions of systemic risk (SPSR), as an indicator of a situational threat compromising risks to physical health, psychological health, the economy, social relations, health system, and others. This indicator was the core of a social sensing approach applied to crisis situations, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic through a content analysis of more than 130.000 public comments from Facebook™ users, in COVID-19 related publications. This content coding allowed creating a SPSR index monitored during a one-year descriptive longitudinal analysis. This index correlated with co-occurring events within the social system, namely epidemiological indicators across measurement cycles (e.g. new deaths; cumulative number of infection cases; Intensive Care Unit hospitalizations) and tended to reflect the epidemiological situation severity (e.g. with the highest level registered during the worst pandemic wave). However, discrepancies also occurred, with high SPSR registered in a low severity situation, i.e. low number of hospitalizations and deaths (e.g. school year beginning), or low SPSR in a high severity situation (e.g. 2nd pandemic wave during Christmas), showing other factors beyond the epidemiological situation contributing to the social perceptions. After each ‘crisis period’ with SPSR peaking, there was a ‘restoration period’, consistently decreasing towards average levels of the previous measurement cycle. This can either indicate social resilience (recovery and resources potentiation) or risk attenuation after a high-severity period. This study serves as preliminary proof of concept of a crises social sensing approach, enabling monitoring of social system dynamics for various crisis types, such as health crisis or the climate crisis. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; crises; crisis communication; SARS-CoV-2; social sensing; systemic risks","","R.

This includes people’s trust in science, and in clinical and public health solutions. Unequivocally, community and patient trust are foundational to the adoption and maintenance of health-related behaviors, social norms, and policies. Yet, trust has to be earned and developed over time and through multiple interactions. Trust is about dialogue and human connection. It’s about listening and knowing that one interaction will not be enough to build trust. It is also influenced by a variety of social, economic, cultural, and political factors, past experiences, and the history of specific communities and patient groups. It should be at the core of the health and social systems with which people interact. More recently, trust in evidence-based information has also been affected by misinformation, not only on social media but also in a variety of community, institutional, and patient settings.

A qualitative case study was conducted based on innovation diffusion theory, which contains 17 interviews and observations of the daily work of eight family health teams involved in the use of technology in a city of western Minas Gerais. The data were processed by thematic-categorial content analysis and systematized with the software Atlas Ti. Communication means and interpersonal communication channels were found to strengthen technology diffusion. Acceptance of the innovation was fostered by the nurse, who encouraged and mobilized the team in this direction. It was observed that some factors contributed to resistance. For example, doctors and other professionals with longer work hours considered that the technology was complex and the time available insufficient. Diffusion of technology was also affected by strategies deriving from the social system context: creation of typing scales, reliefs and agreements, among others. Some challenges have emerged: coexistence of technologies related to the Electronic Health Record and the clinical record, conflicts, structural and training deficiencies, and underused technology. It was found that the elements communication channels, time and social system influence innovation diffusion, mainly by fostering its adoption in the context studied. © 2021, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

We propose that the minimum attributes required for any entity to take part in communication -and hence in society- are the access to the medium of meaning, and to a shared mediality, implying in turn both material and semiotic conditions. Thus, we propose the idea of a 'cosmic sociology', and we discuss its analytical advantages for understanding contemporary society in its human and non-human dimensions. © 2022 Universidad de Chile.

However, what sets engineering apart from other professions is the direct responsibility of engineers to think critically and design innovative solutions to solve complex problems in social systems. Unfortunately, the solutions often do not consider the dynamics of the environment or the cultures that will receive them, leading to obsolescence due to the lack of technical knowledge of maintenance and repair. This exacerbates the disruptive power of technology in culture and society, leading to a gap in engineering education that needs to be addressed. Critical theories attempt to reformulate the teaching and practice of engineering in social-environmental contexts of vulnerability, utilizing systemic models to anticipate solutions based on possible scenarios. However, these theories do not consider the mental models of professional engineers, relying mostly on educational studies. To address this gap, this article explores a novel approach to the problem of sustainability mindset in engineering by understanding the characteristics and structures of engineering systems of practice and conveying it through causal loop diagrams. The results identify causal loops that reinforce or affect the application of sustainable practices, which can be used as leverage points within the systems of practice structure to improve the performance and interest of engineering students in sustainable development endeavors and promote more professionals working with a sustainable mindset. © 2023 by the authors.","professional practice; sustainable mindset; systemic models; systems dynamics","","A.

After this ""uprising,"" the Government declared the state of exception, with a type of violence that has not been seen since the last dictatorship, which triggered in our collective memory images of our recent past and which attacked us both physically and symbolically. It was an incursion in the field of mnemotechnics that brought to light the open relationships between past and present and which made clear our forms of resistance and their continuities. Just as, during the autarchy, several female artists and citizens put their bodies on stage through brave and creative actions that revealed the violence imposed, today, other artistic and aesthetic-political practices place the body back in the public space in order to imagine a livable life. With them, with their actions and artistic practices, we go through some works of arts, actions, and performances that, in their social practice, bring us closer to the current challenges in defense of life. These works invoke that other writing of history to create not only new ways of doing and narrating our corporeity and fractured subjectivities, but also to articulate and enhance our memories and resistances from the collective in order to transform the/our world. © 2022 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

However, the conceptualization of corporate law and governance according to pluralist principles rarely exists. This Essay is the first in the legal literature to address this deficiency by providing a unique pluralist theory of corporate governance regimes. It distinguishes between the plurality of corporate law's sources, values, and principles, and discusses the implications for governance. Moreover, based on the social systems' thinking and the framework of complexity, this Essay provides theoretical grounds for skepticism about any policies or structures applicable to all times and contexts. Therefore, rather than perceiving corporate governance as being identically applicable to all corporations, the law must meet the challenge of complexity by designing governance arrangements following a firm-specific perspective. Furthermore, I argue that in conditions of complexity, corporate governance eco-systems should be designed with a firm-specific view that incorporates the effect of the corporation participants' heterogeneity, the heterogeneity of its internal power relations, and the heterogeneity of industries and markets. These novel arguments have profound implications for redesigning fundamental legal doctrines - such as fiduciary duties of controlling shareholders, regulation of related party transactions, the officers' duty of care, and the company purpose.  © 2022 The Author(s).","","","L.

We examined whether the very closeness that heterosexual women share with their male romantic partners predicts their justification of gender inequality. We drew on intergroup-related research, showing that positive perceptions that minority groups develop within harmonious intergroup interactions, generalize to affect their views of group-based inequality. We expected that to the extent that women experience their romantic relationships positively, they will be more accepting of gender inequality within their homes, and these perceptions will generalize to predict justification of macro-level gender inequality. Five correlational and two experimental studies supported this prediction. The more women rated (or were primed with) their relationship as positive, the more they justified the gender social system. This was mediated by women’s perception of their housework division as fair, and was less pronounced among feminists.

The article offers abundant ethnographic data in conversation with the historical contexts of ethnic homogenization through the state project of mestizaje, which permeates even the internal structures of banking organizations. We discuss symbols of tradition, religion, and status that were key in shaping the bank's identity in the past and that now weigh on the bank's contemporary commitment to being a dynamic institution with responsible, inclusive, and diverse internal structures and workplace interactions.

However, it needs processes that reactivate it in the social sphere from studies that glimpse a symbiotic relationship, library - user. A particular case refers to the Zenón Solano Ricaurte Public Library in Duitama, an educational space that, since its recognition as a public entity in 1997, was intended to serve as a recreational tool in the teaching-learning processes. However, and beyond the obvious problems it presents, the public library has gone through a series of transformations as a door to free access to knowledge, as a repository of past ideas for present and future generations, and as a promoter of new cultural alternatives for the entertainment and permanence of its users, thus promoting a kind of resistance to encourage its use and keep it from falling into oblivion. This research with a hermeneutic approach, and descriptive scope, collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups the social imaginary built by the user around his or her relationship with the library in question. An imaginary that contributed to the understanding of this space from the individual and collective dimension of the practices of use that surround: the first, by aiming at the consolidation of the self in terms of the resignification of identity based on the affective bond with the library as a space that is travelled, visited, inhabited; and the second, as part of the improvement of interpersonal relations and collaborative dynamics between users of the place. In this way, the proposed reflections have been given from the perceptive processes that configure it not from its historicity but from its symbolic validity as a territory that promotes cultural practices. In the same way, it conceives the citizen as a social being who cohabits with the environment in search of achieving his personal development objectives. © 2021.

Relational data of fishers have been used in this paper as a lens through which to explore the status of their participation in Marine Protected Area (MPA) management and to identify structural and contextual barriers to participation. Fieldwork was carried out during 2013–2015 in Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas MPA (CPH-MPA) using a mixed method approach involving the collection and analysis of data from institutional surveys and community meetings. The analysis shows that the fishers’ self-perception of having low influence in decision-making is consistent with the perception towards fishers of the wider social system. Several barriers and constraints to participation in CPH-MPA management are identified. The inefficient structure of the information exchange network further explained fishers’ feelings of distrust and marginalisation regarding decision-making. Understanding how structural barriers make it difficult to set in motion a collective learning process – necessary for an efficient decision-making process – breaks new ground for the design of interventions. Recommendations include clarifying the scope for participation in an appropriate institutional setting and careful consideration of the space in which dialogue takes place in order to integrate diverse knowledge and to acknowledge differential power relations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive management; Collective learning; Network analysis; Perceptions; Stakeholders’ participation","Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas Marine Reserve; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; adaptive management; collective action; fishery management; network analysis; participatory approach; perception; small scale industry; stakeholder","M.

Population generally prefers assisted reproduction techniques because they guarantee continuation of the own genetic heritage and do not entail the participation of third parties. In the social system of preferences, subrogation is relegated to the last place. A small number of works have tried to identify and analyse the factors determining the degree of acceptance of surrogate pregnancy. Controversial issues, such as commercial or ""closed"" subrogation, are not frequently included into public opinion surveys. When inquiring about the social representation of surrogate pregnant women, the approach adopted by most of the surveys reproduces the image created and broadcasted by mainstream media, ignoring the findings presented by both ethnography and research specifically aimed at assessing the results of subrogation agreements. Most opinion studies frame the public's views within a medical approach. Studies that inquiry about the degree of acceptance of subrogation for ""social"" reasons are exceptional, despite the fact that the development of assisted reproduction techniques takes place in parallel with the emergence of new family forms. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Therefore, the theoretical discussion is proposed in which the notions of different disciplines are expanded and interpreted, in order to sustain that in Venezuela, this social process of assimilation of violence in the general social dynamic led to the installation of a Culture of Violence and this, at the same time, fed the violent action by extending it both qualitatively and quantitatively in Venezuelan society. It is concluded that different social and institutional factors produced a failure in Venezuelan social system to sustain the validity of the norm and culturally and institutionally acceptable behavior. As a consequence, violence entered the social structure and, not being effectively sanctioned, it was legitimized as an acceptable behavior for obtaining social gratifications, while at the same time institutions were delegitimized, causing violence to be presented as a socially accepted action for the individual and even for the same institutions, thus promoting a generation of individuals more socially prone to violence. © 2020 Policia Nacional de Colombia.

Mystics of various persuasions have generally held that such paradoxes are the best means of expressing within language, truths about a whole that is sundered by the very operation of language itself. Any effort, it is said, to analyze these paradoxes and provide them with logical sense is doomed from the start because logic itself rests upon assumptions, such as the principles of non-contradiction and excluded middle, that are violated by the mystical ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Mathematical development of a dialectical logic with truth-values in a complex field. Findings: The coincidentia oppositorum is a common trope in many religious traditions, particularly those with a mystical or initiatory aspect, and fields of knowledge such as Psychology and Quantum Physics, with wave-particle duality. The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical theory of the coincidence of opposites, and where truth-values are expressed in a complex field. A propositional coincidentia oppositorum algebra is developed. Originality/value: Although the literature of paraconsistent logics is abundant, the authors think that this is the first time that a dialectical logic has been developed with truth-values belonging to a complex field. The impossibility of reaching an absolute truth from opposite propositions is discovered, both being true, because of the existence of irrational numbers in the truth-values. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absolute truth; Coincidentia oppositorum; Contradiction; Denier; Dialectics; Dialectics coincidentia oppositorum proposition; Infinity; Mystic and mythical systems; Paraconsistency; Polar propositions; Social systems; Superstructure","Philosophical aspects; Absolute truth; Coincidentia oppositorum; Contradiction; Denier; Dialectics; Dialectics coincidentia oppositorum proposition; Infinity; Paraconsistency; Polar propositions; Social systems; Superstructure; Computer circuits","J.L.

Drawing on this tension, the article advances an interpretation of the critical potential of Luhmann’s conceptualization of law by pointing out that the normative form of society emerges out of conflicts about the form of the normative within society. This formulation supposes that the unfolding of law is not the rational completion of higher principles into unified social structures, but a contradictory outcome semantically produced through endless iterations of the difference between what is legal and what is illegal. In doing so, it argues for a sociological reconsideration of the work of juridical concepts in the everyday operation of legal communications, as well as in the normatively guided search for what is non-actualized within the existing scope of positive legal forms. By reading Luhmann along the lines of a critical engagement with the law, the article further calls for exploring constituent moments as instances of reflexive instability that signal the unmarked space of normativity and bring the politicality of concepts to the fore. © The Author(s) 2019.","Critique; dialectics; legal system; Luhmann; norms; sociology of concepts","","R.

The article evinces certain difficulties faced by the social sciences when trying to give adequate responses to the problems posed by social reality in our region. In the best of cases, we have partial analyses on specific social phenomena, whose connection and interrelation with other processes is not elaborated on. In this problematic context, we consider it relevant to ask ourselves how social or sociological theory is constructed or developed. Clearly, much has been said about this issue in epistemological and methodological reflections. However, these perspectives are fruitless when the problem we are facing does not have that much to do with the conditions for validation or legitimization of a theory, as with the more fundamental question of its conditions of possibility. We do not consider it adequate either to uphold a series of speculations regarding how we imagine a theory emerges or is created, something that is also frequent in the existing literature. In order to avoid this, we believe it is necessary to focus on theoretical practices themselves, that is, attend to the manner in which thinkers in our field have built their theoretical perspectives. For purposes of this article and with an exploratory purpose, we have taken as referent Niklas Luhmann's sociological theory, especially his book Social Systems. Our objective is to identify in the text the operations, strategies, and resources through which the author presents his theoretical discourse and makes it recognizable within the academic and scientific community. We hope that the recognition of these constructive operations stimulates theoretical elaboration in the social sciences, on the basis of an improved understanding of what theory is and theorizing takes place. © 2019 Revista Colombiana de Sociología.","Social structures; Social theory; Sociology of sociology; Theoretical construction; Theoretical practice; Theory of social systems","","","","Universidad Nacional de Colombia","0120159X","","","","Spanish","Rev.

In the 1960s, Jacobs created the conditions for institutional change by offering a thorough critique of the “Radiant Garden City Beautiful” orthodoxy of urban planning and presenting a solution for the problems that she saw with this approach. She argued that the top-down, design-oriented planning of her time hurt the lives of individual residents and diminished society as a whole. Her solution was a new way of seeing the city: as a functional and efficient social system. Since the 1990s, a global planning orthodoxy – of which Jacobs' ideas are part – developed around the “Smart Sustainable Resilient City.” This orthodoxy has been subject to critique, but Susan Fainstein's Just City theory offers tools for comprehensively challenging the approach and a solution for addressing the problems. In order to demonstrate the need for institutional change within the Smart Sustainable Resilient City orthodoxy, I use the Just City theoretical perspective to interpret the results of an analysis of green gentrification in New York City between 1990 and 2014. I argue that the over-valuation of Jacobsian diversity within the current urban planning orthodoxy generates unjust outcomes. The just green city, then, requires de-emphasizing Jacobs' intellectual project in favor of her far more important institutional project. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Jane Jacobs; Just City; New York City; Proportionate universalism; Urban greening","New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; garden city; gentrification; ideology; institutional reform; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban planning","J.J.T.

We refer specifically to those assets control or possession of which can help explain hierarchies within the social stratification system. For this purpose, we examine E.O. Wright's concepts of social class and exploitation. This neo-Marxist sociologist has indicated that the dominant socioeconomic and political system of socialist societies like the USSR represented a specific mode of production. In this regard, the mechanism of economic exploitation was different from the capitalist mode of production. In a nationalised, centralised and planned economy, control over decisions that preserve the bureaucracy (concerning the organisation of production and distribution) helps to determine the share of social wealth. Thus in the USSR, the higher classes, comprising high-ranking bureaucrats and highly qualified specialists, possessed the economic power to decide the destiny of their socially generated excess and enjoyed a higher level of well-being, defined as the relationship between leisure and work. Had democratisation of the economic management occurred, including greater access among the unprivileged classes to organisational assets, the bureaucrats would have seen their capacity to appropriate social wealth cut significantly. Finally, we question specific means of recruitment to higher positions in the social system of stratification. © 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.

The main aim of this article is to observe the possible existence of a technological generation gap, based on the study of the available lists of lexicon in relation to eight centres of interest, directly or indirectly related to Information and Knowledge Technologies (ICT), as well as to a sociological questionnaire. On the hand one, pre-university students and, on the other, students of a permanent adult education centre located in Málaga, form the sample of this study. This way, we seek to gather and analyse the available lexicon related to new technologies of the considered population. The correlation between lexical and sociological variables will offer relevant information about associations and conditioning factors in both directions. It is based on the hypothesis that older generations are acquainted with fewer vocabulary referred to new technologies. In addition, this lexicon covers a very general and superficial range of technological applications. Moreover, young people with pre-university secondary education studies possess not only more lexicon but, surely, more specialized and specific. The results show a great disparity between the compiled vocabulary from groups of young people and adults. Our final aim regarding this study, is to contribute to the creation of an action plan that alleviate adverse effects of the technology generation gap on those groups that are vulnerable from a social point of view. © The Author(s) 2019.","generation gap; lexical availability; new technologies; vocabulary","","","","Universidad de Valladolid","18873731","","","","Spanish","Ogigia.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108171703"

However, what to expect when a radical change in policy occurs? This is the situation in Brazil, which has been ruled by the left over the last fourteen years, and by a center-right government in the previous eight years, which has been ruled by the far right from 2019 onwards. The speech, besides demagogic and populism demonstrations, has revealed possibilities of setbacks in several areas, causing particular stress to the area of education. The ideas “school without party” and “school without sex education” are two points of this program that are problematic. What is behind these programmatic points? The matter of the article questions the occurrence of any setback in the field of education that may be imposed by the legislation. Therefore, the article examines the function of law, the evolution of the legal system and the theory of communication, taking as its starting point and theoretical reference Niklas Luhmann's Theory of Autopoietic Social Systems in the analysis of the education system and the legal system. © 2020.

In the context of socio-ecological systems, there is a wide variety of conceptual and methodological approaches for the assessment of social vulnerability in face of environmental change. However, there is a need for making these approaches more operational. Among the aspects that have been pointed out in previous literature as current research needs are (i) the identification of variables that are determinant for the construction of a vulnerability index, (ii) the analysis of the problems derived from the availability of information for the vulnerability evaluation, (iii) spatial representation of a vulnerability index and (iv) the design of strategies to identify the responses of different types of beneficiaries at local scale.

Functional differentiation emerged from the relationship between Europe and America. Moreover, multilayered networks also became formed, co-evolving with functional differentiation in America and giving a particular character to American differentiation. Setting out from Niklas Luhmann's concept of functional differentiation and a historical-evolutionary analysis of the process of differentiation in America, we identify particular moments of this development and its main features. We conclude that Latin American sociology requires the adoption of an evolutionary approach to society to decentralize its vision from the present, escape the methodological nationalism that characterizes it, and transform itself into the sociology of world society. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).","Centre/periphery; Functional differentiation; Latin America; Networks; Niklas Luhmann; Stratification; Systems theory","","","","Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)","22383875","","","","Spanish","Sociol.

First, a brief diagnosis about the importance of trust in scientific expertise in contemporary society and how this process has been analyzed in the specialized literature will be made. Then, the description of scientific knowledge will be analyzed from the point of view of the functional systemic model. Using the concepts of functional differentiation and structural coupling, it will be argued that scientific knowledge is here considered a specialized form of communication characteristic of a functional system. Next, the approximation of the formal-pragmatic model is described. Of special importance here are the ideas of lifeworld and public sphere. On the basis of these characterizations, the visions of these authors are compared and the differences are analyzed in relation to their conceptualization of expertise. It is then suggested that the differences between these two models in relation to the ontological status of the lifeworld shape their views of scientific expertise as well as current debates on this topic.

A qualitative-interpretative research was developed, using semi-structured interviews technique. The results are analyzed from the theoretical elements of compulsory heterosexuality, stigma and family as produced and producing a social system of material and symbolic relationships. It is noted that although these families have historically existed, they continue to experience manifestations of invisibility, homophobia, discrimination and violence in different contexts, as a result of normalization of the hegemonic model of the heterosexual nuclear family. It is concluded that the visibility and politicization of LGBTI families allows to de-essentialize the conceptions of family associated with reproduction and gender binarism, and should be read as a space of tension and transformation of the societal order, however challenges are presented at the macro and microsocial levels, to overcome the indicated sociocultural barriers. © 2020 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

The reasons for their departure to other countries lie in the deficiencies of the Spanish university system. Drawing from the concepts of habitus (Pierre Bourdieu) and autopoiesis (Niklas Luhmann), 13 semistructured interviews were conducted with researchers chosen by snowball sampling. The informants highlight faculty hiring mechanisms, which in their view have not improved significantly even after the introduction of an accreditation system in 2008. The results also show the poor image of Spanish Communication research abroad, as it is regarded as disconnected from the international trends in the field. The improvements identified by the consulted sample indicate a slow but steady incorporation of Spanish research into the international sphere. However, this is insufficient, in the opinion of the interviewees, to stimulate a possible return of emigrated talent to Spanish higher education institutions. Insufficient and intermittent research funding is one of the most relevant roadblocks. Convergence with the systems leading the world’s scientific production today is still perceived as an unlikely and remote scenario. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This article is the result of the evolution of the research path traced by the authors, who in an earlier moment performed an analysis of the medical system and its operation from its own binary code, in order to visualize the space of prevention in the relationship between medical system with the health system in the context of Social Systems Theory. The article presented the confirmation of this theoretical path, using vaccination as a privileged locus for observing the relationship between prevention and the medical and health system. © Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.","Health; Medicine; Prevention; System; Theory of social systems","","","","Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos","21752168","","","","Portuguese","Rev.

From this point of view, it presents the evidence of risks pointed out by scholars as well as the discussions already performed at an international level considering their necessary and emerging regulation. Methodology: This article uses the methodology of literature survey and a systemic-constructivist framework to approach the risks, in the light of Niklas Luhmann’s concept of society of risk to discuss why nanotechnological risks should be taken into account. Results: The investigation has as conclusion that, despite the clear evidence of risks, so far there has been no regulation aiming at the development of this technology with investments in safety for the purpose of controlling environmental and human risks. Important issues must be taken into account in the national internal development of a “nanolaw”. Contributions: As a contribution, this paper discusses some of the main events already held at an international level focusing on the regulation of nanotechnology for its safe development with regard to the environment and human beings. At these events reports were issued supporting the need to share information and also to enter into an international agreement on safety measures designed to face nanotechnologial risks by implementing risk management. © 2020, Centro Universitário Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

We approach these questions through the lens of collective action and cultural resilience, to understand the evolution of communal governance. We analyze a case study of the Comite de Paramo Ñukanchik Urku, a multicommunal organization created in the 1990s for collective resource management. We use the analytical framework of social-ecological systems (SES) to approach changes of the agricultural frontiers and grazing activities as conservation outcomes resulting from changes in resource units, actors, and governance structures. Through a mixed-method approach combining air photo analysis (years 1956, 1993, and 2008) and qualitative research, we examine spatial patterns of settlement and agricultural frontier expansion, historical grazing practices, and the main elements of current collective paramo management. Our results indicate that: (1) the demarcation of an agreed agricultural frontier as a territorial landmark is a response aiming to control the increase of crops and dwellings at higher elevations, and to limit grazing activities; (2) the authority's legitimation of the Committee and its Board is crucial to develop rules and to enforce them; and (3) legitimation is achieved through conservation knowledge and autonomous decisions to control paramos considered a communal territory. A broader comprehension of the context and history of cultural change is needed to understand the emergence of communal governance of paramos. Cultural-political dimensions are key to the cultural resilience of social systems in SES and to strengthening rules and institutional diversity to manage the commons in Andean communities. © 2019 Lopez-Sandoval and Maldonado.","Andes; collective resource management, communal governance; cultural resilience; Ecuador; paramos; social-ecological systems","Andes; Ecuador; collective action; governance approach; institutional framework; resource management; territory","","","International Mountain Society","02764741","","","","English","Mt.

In this scenario, the ethical and political appeal of Henry David Thoreau's concept of civil disobedience is more compelling than ever, thus fully justifying the production of a film such as Estrada de Palha (Straw Road) (2012). If in his work, the Portuguese director sought to show the urgency of civil disobedience acts in present-day Portuguese society, producing a western influenced by the political philosophy of Thoreau in Resistance to Civil Government (1849), this essay will necessarily have to reflect upon this influence and the various aspects of the timeliness of the American author's thoughts, while identifying interesting parallels with Alberto Carneiro, the main cinematographically created character of the film. Conceiving his film as a western set in Alentejo, which does not lack references to Ford, Leone, Jarmusch, Jodorowsky or Canijo, Rodrigo Areias was able to contrast violence with bucolicism, disobedience with passivity and conflict with peace, reconciling that which is irreconcilable, and creating strong imaginary equivalents to Thoreau's ethical concept of passive resistance. As a result, this study proposes to address how this film evokes the American western imagination and its distinctive codes, observing the process of its deconstruction into a Portuguese identity and its reconciliation with the subversive imagination of American Transcendentalism which Thoreau integrates. Suitable for representing an unstable sociopolitical environment, the western is undoubtedly one of the genres that best represents social systems in crisis, where acts of passive resistance will be most tested by their direct confrontation with the misuse of power, including a constant legitimation of usurpation and corruption. In line with its director, this essay will argue that Estrada de Palha has become more interesting because it is an admittedly Portuguese western that develops aesthetic and ethical means of political awareness based on current national reality, being neither a cliché of the genre nor a film with a strong ideological agenda. © 2019 University of Lisbon.

Social resilience becomes relevant in coping, recovery, adaptation and transformation actions by society. Social resilience evidences both action of social agents and institutions to overcome the negative state they face. Through this process, society can be identified as resilient. But, if social resilience is only defined as ability or property of the social systems, then there is no certainty about efficient actions to overcome a crisis. Therefore, this paper aims to demonstrate resilience as a social phenomenon that, according to Kant, it is perceived and understood from its active manifestation, and, based on Simmel's theory, it has an analytical analogy to conflict. The analysis starts about different definitions of social resilience and, in the second section, uses several investigations about resilient behavior of individuals and groups to demonstrate the above mentioned. The literature review enabled to fit the heuristic method of recognition of resilience in as a process and social phenomenon. Subsequently, the paper proposes the use of resile as a categorical concept referred to all resilient actions. © 2020, Corporation for the Management and Reduction of Disaster Risk in Chile (GRID-Chile).

Recent, abundant empirical data of language use is analyzed within an analytic model of population dynamics. This model contemplates the possibilities of both long-term language coexistence and decline. The data needs to be interpreted under different circumstances. The most likely scenario, we find, is a sustained coexistence. Extreme cases still lead to the decline of one of the tongues–we delimit when this can happen. Asymptotic behavior is often an unreliable predictor in complex social systems; we make an attempt at forecasting fractions of speakers towards 2030. These also suggest sustained coexistence, but some counterintuitive dynamics are unveiled. Model parameters estimated from the data convey relevant information about the prestige and interlinguistic similarity of both tongues. We quantify these parameters rigorously for these languages for the first time. Remarkably, Spanish is found to have a larger prestige in areas which historically had larger Catalan monolingual communities. With limited, spatially-segregated data we examine more fine grained dynamics, thus better addressing the likely outcomes. Differences in model parameters across regions reveal how the two languages are perceived in more urban or rural environments. © 2019, The Author(s).","","","J.

A conceptual model is developed to manage the complexity of integrating circular economy principles, digital transformation, and tools and frameworks for sustainability into business models. The proposed architecture is multilevel and multiscale in order to achieve the instantiation of the sustainable value chain in any territory. The architecture promotes the incorporation of circular economy and holonic principles into new circular business models. This integrated perspective of business model can support the design and upgrade of the manufacturing companies in their respective industrial sectors. The conceptual model proposed is based on activity theory that considers the interactions between technical and social systems and allows the mitigation of the metabolic rift that exists between natural and social metabolism. This study contributes to the existing literature on circular economy, circular business models and activity theory by considering holonic paradigm concerns, which have not been explored yet.

It centered its attention in unveiling complex components of such systems, from the constitution of curricular elements, dimensions and structures for its modernization and reconfiguration in Colombia. It was carried out using a mixed method analysis approach on a stratified sampling of 3 different populations, teachers in diverse stages and places of practice; it found new understandings in 3 primary niches. The first one, the discernment of the educational spectrum as a field that subsumes systems of education being fed by open social systems. The second one, reconfiguring the subjects and their position as the center of the being and doing of the related systems of the education field; assuming, at least, seven complex principles, generating a third niche that links education actions to school actions.

The Southern Lapwing (Vanellus chilensis) is known for the vigorous nest defense against predators, however, this response can vary from silent flight with distraction maneuvers to the predator (passive defense), to strident flights of direct attack on predators (defense active). This study examines the relationship between the behavioral patterns of nest defense, nature of nearby stimuli, embryonic development and reproductive success of the Southern Lapwing in the wild in Colombia. Ringed and reproductively active pairs were submitted to three stimuli that represented potential threats to the nest (walking person, rider and tractor) and their behavioral responses were classified into different categories according to their intensity. The defense of the nest varied according to the stage of embryonic development of the chicks; with an early embryonic development, the defense was mainly passive and as the embryonic development advanced, the active defense was increased. The rider was the stimulus that triggered the greatest active defense while, before the walking person and the tractor, the response was mainly passive. The distance at which the birds left the nests on the approach of a stimulus correlated with the nature of the same. Adults tolerated the tractor closer to the nest than to the stimuli of walking person and rider, which suggests discrimination between stimuli. The males performed twice as direct attack flights as the females. Reproductive success was not correlated with the category of defense intensity of the manifested nest or with the clucht size. © 2020 Universidad de Caldas.","Aggression; Colombia; Embryonic development; Parental care; Predation; Southern lapwing","","L.

At the risk of rushing to deliver a thesis on a situation that is still in progress -although it is in pause due to the coronavirus health emergency-, some ideas can be offered that are based on the theoretical approaches of both Karl Marx and Niklas Luhmann. This connection allows for the development of a systematic observation framework to detect the objective triggers of the concentration crises in which Chilean society is immersed. The analysis presented here seeks to investigate the form that such a concentration takes, namely: a concentration of the achievements of the different social systems. This kind of concentration, taken to the extreme in the Chilean case, contributes to the generation of stratification schemes, homogenizes the diversity of options and choices of the social systems and, captured in inertial patterns of growth, ends up producing crises scenarios such as the one visible today. In this context, it is possible to maintain, at the end of this paper, that only a decision that allows society to face the inherent logic of concentration might be able to offer a definitive way out of the convulsion witnessed in Chile. © 2020 Universidad Adolfo Ibanez.

In the context of postcolonial theories, the post-foundationalist point of view leads to the deconstruction of hegemonic and eurocentric discourses on modernity, operating a critical observation of cognitive and practical operations that build, in an essentialist register, national identities and cases based on self-(neo)colonialist understandings of the so-called central or developed countries. To the extent that Niklas Luhmann’s social theory starts from very similar ontological and epistemological assumptions, one might expect a deconstructive approach also in his theory of modern society, but until now prevails almost unanimously the perception that the Luhmannian conception of world society is incorrigibly eurocentric. Can this theory of world society not be eurocentric? Relying on more recent and less orthodox debates on this theory, it is argued in this communication that Luhmann’s theory of world society can be adopted in favor of criticism of the hegemonic and eurocentric discourse on modernity. © 2020, Universidade de Brasilia.

This trend exacerbates the traditional tension between academic freedom and managerial control – a major challenge for the administration of academic institutions. The ideas of Charles Darwin represent an opportunity for overcoming such a challenge. However, traditional managerial models show inadequate, pre-Darwinian assumptions for devising organizational designs. This paper aims to show not only the opportunities but also the challenges of embracing a Darwinian paradigm for designing social systems. The case of managerialism in universities is an illustrative example. The paper proposes evolutionary guidelines for designing universities capable of maintaining managerial control while warranting academic freedom. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes to understand the tension between academic freedom and managerial control in universities as the same tension between freedom and control that Karl Popper identified as successfully handled by evolutionary processes. The paper uses Darwinian theory, understood as a broader theory for complex systems, as a heuristic for designing social systems – universities in this case – able to adapt to changing environmental conditions while handling equilibrium between freedom and control. The methodology articulates the Popperian model of knowledge with the Darwinian scheme proposed by David Ellerman known as “parallel experimentation” for suggesting organizational forms in which university administrators and faculty can interact for generating free innovations in pseudo-controlled organizational arrangements. Findings: A salient characteristic of strong managerialism is its pre-Darwinian understanding of survival and adaptation; such an approach shows important flaws that can lead universities to unfit designs that changing environments can select for elimination. As an alternative, the philosophy behind the ideas of Charles Darwin provides guidelines for designing innovative and adaptive social systems. Evolutionary principles challenge basic tenets of strong managerialism as Darwinian designs discard the possibility of seeing managers as knowledgeable designers that allegedly can avoid mistakes by allocating resources to “one-best” solutions through ex ante exhaustive, top-down control. Instead, a Darwinian model requires considering survival as a matter of adaptability through continuous experimentation of blind trials controlled by ex post selection. The key is to organize universities as experimenting systems that try new and different things all the time and that learn and improve by making mistakes, as an adaptive system. Research limitations/implications: Governing and managing universities require to acknowledge the uniqueness of academic institutions and demand to look for appropriate forms of organization. The proposal of this paper opens possibilities for exploring and implementing action-research initiatives and practical solutions for universities. Studies in management and administration of higher-education institutions must take into account the characteristics of this type of organizations and should consider wider spectrums of possibilities beyond the core ideas of managerialism. Practical implications: University managers face a special challenge for achieving equilibrium between managerial control and academic freedom. Darwinian models of management invite to reconsider several management creeds, for instance, that “errors are bad things” – instead of innovation triggers and learning opportunities or that “one solution must fit all” – instead of considering bottom-up, different and adaptive solutions triggered by local academic units, each facing different environments. Originality/value: Currently, there is no clear picture for governing universities. This paper introduces principles and guidelines for facing the current challenge that strong managerialism represents if universities are expected to maintain academic freedom and also survive in volatile environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic freedom; Adaptation; Control; Evolution; Evolutionary design; Popper; Social systems design; University","Adaptive systems; Biology; Control engineering; Facings; Academic freedom; Adaptation; Evolution; Evolutionary design; Popper; Social systems; University; Managers","C.

Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform is one concept with ~ 80 initiatives globally. Objectives: As an exercise in learning through evaluation we audited (1) the siting, construction and maintenance of individual LTSER platforms, and (2) them as a distributed infrastructure for place-based transdisciplinary research with focus on the European continent. Methods: First, we defined a normative model for ideal performance at both platform and network levels. Second, four surveys were sent out to the 67 self-reported LTSER platforms officially listed at the end of 2016. Third, with a focus on the network level, we analyzed the spatial distribution of both long-term ecological monitoring sites within LTSER platforms, and LTSER platforms across the European continent. Fourth, narrative biographies of 18 platforms in different stages of development were analyzed. Results: While the siting of LTSER platforms represented biogeographical regions well, variations in land use history and democratic governance were not well represented. Platform construction was based on 2.1 ecological monitoring sites, with 72% ecosystem and 28% social system research. Maintenance of a platform required three to five staff members, focused mostly on ecosystem research, was based mainly on national funding, and had 1–2 years of future funding secured. Networking with other landscape approach concepts was common. Conclusions: Individually, and as a network, LTSER platforms have good potential for transdisciplinary knowledge production and learning about sustainability challenges. To improve the range of variation of Pan-European social–ecological systems we encourage interfacing with other landscape approach concepts. © 2018, The Author(s).","Europe; Landscape approach; Learning through evaluation; Social–ecological system; Stakeholder engagement; Transdisciplinary research","Europe; biography; infrastructure planning; interdisciplinary approach; knowledge based system; landscape planning; learning; research program; research work; stakeholder","P.

To reach the objective was to carried out documentary analysis and the contributions of educational cybernetics were assessed for the sake of systematically understanding the processes of social interaction an interactivity that are carried out in this educational model. As results was found that educational cybernetics makes it possible to recognize actors and contexts, because it provides clarity on the composition of the systems that are articulated when it comes to training future professionals.

The study area has an area of 1,635.6 km2, distributed in the sub-basins of the Carchi, Apaquí and El Ángel rivers, and their micro-basins, in which the main agricultural activity and the highest population concentration are found. For the purposes of this work, social perception of risk is understood as the ability of people to form impressions and make inferences about the natural and anthropic threats that they recur. The study and analysis procedure of the information collected in the aforementioned area consisted of four phases: 1. Application of a survey model to a random and non-probabilistic sample of 120 producers settled in the study area; 2. Determination of the annual average values of rainfall; temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the 49 microbasins; 3. Calculation of the aridity index and 4. Determination of drought risk levels. The results obtained allowed us to determine, in terms of the social perception of the study area, that 52% of people considered drought as the greatest threat of natural disaster; Potatoes, beans and corn being the most affected crops. It is pertinent to highlight that the risk of drought rather than an agroclimatic event, whose direct effect is the reduction of crop yields, must be visualized from a more integrated perspective; that is to say, reflecting that the consequences of natural disasters are not independent of social systems.

The specific thematic cut must be the jurisprudence of the STF in the context of constitutional issues of relevant social, economic and political interest, delimiting the spectrum of temporal analysis to the validity of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988. The hypothesis to be defended is that the Theory of Systems offers satisfactory theoretical tools to understand sensitive issues in Excelso Pretorio. The arguments to be raised orbit around the intrinsic complexity of the system for resolving legal demands and legal instability as a product of this complexification, in addition to addressing the efficiency of macroscopic choices for the better functioning of complex judicial systems. Methodology: The methodology that is intended to be used is analytical-descriptive and the theoretical framework is Luhmann's theory just mentioned. Results: The partial conclusion we intend to reach is in the sense of proving the hypothesis raised, that is, that an understanding of the Brazilian precedent system that considers the Systems Theory can positively contribute to a better elaboration of the structural design of the standardization and stabilization of national jurisprudence. Contributions: The study addresses the STF jurisprudence in the context of constitutional issues of relevant social, economic and political interest, whose hypothesis to be defended is that the Systems Theory offers satisfactory theoretical tools to understand sensitive issues in Excelso Pretorio. © 2020, Centro Universitário Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

Refusing to consider abstract entities as actors, it helps us better determine who the relevant actors are in each international conflict and gives special attention to the existing power relations between them. Accordingly, it is considered that a large social system is made up of numerous actors with multiple conflicts between them. Thus, in the case of international conflicts, we do not face one single conflict, but a conflictual complex involving a multitude of actors with their different power resources, who weave a network of conflicts and power relations between them, and at its top a dominant conflict, the conflict around which the other conflicts evolve. Acknowledging the complexity of international conflicts, this new theoretical approach should better explain both the behaviour of the actors and the evolution of the conflictual complex itself. © 2019 Jawaharlal Nehru University.","Conflict; conflict resolution; sociology of power; theory; war","","G.

Laclau maintains that signifiers are per se tendentially empty and that there is some constituting impossibility in every social system, that is, some real in the Lacanian sense. This paper levels two criticisms at this interpretation. Firstly, Lacan never employs the concept “empty signifier”: His definition of the signifier as that which represents a subject—and his enjoyment—for another signifier contradicts this emptiness. Secondly, in the place of the impossible, Lacan puts enjoyment. The main political consequence of these two considerations is that the theory of hegemony is mistaken when focusing on the rhetorical debate and forgets that individual political inclinations are based mainly on their enjoyment. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Enjoyment; Hegemony; Lacan; Laclau; Signifier; Subject","","F.

The industry response has often consisted of strategies aimed at mapping knowledge across organizational units, codifying knowledge in databases, and mentoring new staff. However, such common managerial responses show important limitations in terms of grasping tacit and network-based dimensions of knowledge in complex oil production operations. Therefore, there is an industrial need for innovative knowledge management practices. In this conceptual article, we look at the knowledge-loss crisis from the perspective of network resilience in complex systems. A central assumption here is that it is important to look at retiring staff not only in terms of their explicit knowledge, but also in relation to their roles in evolving networks of interactions. Why do some social systems adapt to the departure of some individuals, recover from eventual knowledge-loss crises, and keep performing its functions? From an anticipatory logic, network analysis may show the initial conditions of a system and identify possible loss scenarios. From an adaptive logic, network analysis may inform interventions aimed at facilitating processes of interactions from which new knowledge may emerge and spread. Integrated operations may be a step in this direction. © 2019 by the authors.","Aging workforce; Complex adaptive systems; Network analysis; Oil and gas industry; Resilience","","L.

For this reason, these aspects should be considered when designing technology with the purpose to positively impact people in a community. In this paper, we revisit the foundations of culture aiming to bring this concept in dialogue with design. To inform design with cultural aspects, we model reality in three levels of formality: informal, formal, and technical, and subscribe to a systemic vision that considers the technical solution as part of a more complex social system in which people live and interact. In this paper, we instantiate this theoretical and methodological view by presenting two case studies of technology design in which culture-based artefacts were employed to inform the design process. We claim that as important as including issues related to culture in the ICT design agenda—from the conception to the development, evaluation, and adoption of a technology—is the need to support the design process with adequate artefacts that help identifying cultural aspects within communities and translating them into sociotechnical requirements. We argue that a culturally informed perspective on design can go beyond an informative analysis, and can be integrated with the theoretical and methodological framework used to support design, throughout the entire design process. © 2017, The Author(s).","Culture and values in design; Human–computer interaction; Organisational semiotics; Socially aware design","Human computer interaction; Complex social systems; Computer interaction; Cultural aspects; Methodological frameworks; Organisational semiotics; Sociotechnical; Technical solutions; Technology designs; Design","L.S.G.

Thus, industries or firm systems operating on this planet have limits as well. Infinite growth is intrinsically impossible. Some firms have integrated these principles into their management methods while struggling to survive in a traditional competitive environment with short-term economic constraints. This paper explores the managerial practices that help firm systems address these paradoxical tensions of being responsible for the environment and having a long-term degrowth orientation while also successfully competing in traditional capitalistic markets. Using a social system approach, the paper applies functional differentiation focusing on the internal aspects of the management of the firm. The paper highlights that the role of each subsystem can be crucial for integrating the survival of the firm system and the natural system';; limits.

During the period of their emergence, there were several theoretical collisions between these two traditions of thinking of society. The meta-reflection that is developed here makes it possible to analyze how these theoretical traditions are connected. As the current discussion is limited to the perspective of systems theory, it is necessary to amplify the debate and to ask for a connection from the perspective of critical theory. Only through the distinction between critical systems theory, which is increasingly discussed today, and a critical theory of social systems, which is barely discussed, we may be able to recognize the full productivity of these theoretical collisions. Therefore, we understand our metareflection as an intervention that takes the form of sociological self-criticism, which is directed against the risk of theoretical dogmatism and advocates for opening up the contingency of sociology's own thinking about society. © Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH und Co KG.

Since nature itself is transformed by the impact of technology and social systems, the maintenance of the rigid boundary loses its meaning. Heuristically, two examples are presented to think about this double transformation: in Bonneuil, Fressoz, and Jouvancourt, it is the concept of history adopted by the scientists that need to be reviewed by historiography that listen to voices conquered in the construction of the Anthropocene; in Jason Moore, is the concept of nature that needs to be revisited by the historiography of capitalism and world-systems.

However, despite a positive but rather ideological evolution, the country is still facing several water challenges in practice. Water governance is extremely complex due to intricate social structures, important spatial and temporal differences in the availability of water resources, ecological fragility, and weak institutions. A Transdisciplinary Learning Community approach has been adopted by the Universidad Católica Boliviana to take into account the complexity of the water problems caused by social, hydrological, and ecological system imbalances. In this approach, researchers and non-academic actors work closely together to integrate different ways of conceiving, using, valuing, and deciding on water issues. The approach aims at co-creating resilient solutions by recovering and restoring not only the ecological system, but also the social system in which all actors are aware of their role and responsibility. We explain the challenges and concerns raised by this approach in a case study of the Katari River Basin (KRB), which is impacted by a high degree of contamination that is mainly caused while crossing El Alto city, leading to dramatic consequences for the Lake Titicaca ecosystem and its surrounding communities. © 2019 by the authors.","Collaborative learning; Integrated water resource management; Knowledge co-production; River basin management policy; Transdisciplinary learning; Water governance","Bolivia; El Alto; La Paz [Bolivia]; Water management; Watersheds; Collaborative learning; Integrated water resource management; Knowledge co productions; River basin management; Trans-disciplinary learning; Water governance; governance approach; integrated approach; learning; resource availability; resource management; river basin; United Nations; vulnerability; water management; water resource; Ecosystems","A.

Because the theory has a formal-logical foundation, which does not presuppose ontology, there are insurmountable obstacles to achieving this objective. For this reason, it is valid to wonder about the merit of a theory that, after 20 years, insists on not aligning itself with ontological premises in a robust way and suggests, therefore, a refusal to integrate sociology within the set of factual sciences. However, we think that the richness of Luhmann's work allows a dialogue with the mainstream of contemporary theoretical practice. Three rules about what ""should not be done"" are revalidated from this analysis to philosophically base a theory in sociology and a key suggestion to overcome the problem of explanation in Luhmann's sociology: Social science seeks and directs its activity towards discovery and the use of substantive, real distinctions that also enrich the factual content of statements about social reality. © 2020 University of Valparaiso.

This critical approach suggests a paradigm shift on self-managed development, as it reflects on how to address its complexity from the recognition of the territorial autonomy of its inhabitants. To do this, Systemic Thinking is used to structure a territorial reading whose purpose is to understand the territorial dynamics of San Germán (Usme) on the southern edge of Bogotá. The results include, first, a systemic analysis applied to a timeline that exposes the effects of a mechanical and linear institutional response. Second, the text exposes a simultaneous reading of both territorial logics: formal and spontaneous, making explicit the meeting points that involve confrontations. The article concludes that the lack of knowledge of the global implications of institutional action has been strongly linked to the establishment of measures to homogenize the territory under a unique logic of territorial construction. Likewise, that the non-recognition of the logic of Spontaneous Planning and Management will continue to restrict self-managed actions to contexts outside the dialogues in planning scenarios and, with it, to a continuous spontaneous development not assisted, isolated and inaccessible. © 2020 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

This includes the citizen participation in the process of urban planning and transformation, forming a network structured and supported by tools allowing the equal distribution of power in the decision making. The SJVG-MAS Project addresses, in an interdisciplinary approach, the development of computational tools based on Multiagent Systems (MAS) for the simulation of the social production and management processes that occur in urban ecosystems, in particular, the San Jerónimo Vegetable Garden project (Spain). In this paper, we present a MAS-based simulation tool developed in JaCaMo.

However, there are various existing sentiment analysis methods and it is unclear which of them are deployable in the mobile environment. In this paper, we provide the first of a kind study in which we compare the performance of 14 sentence-level sentiment analysis methods in the mobile environment. To do that, we adapted these methods to run on Android OS and then, we measure their performance in terms of memory, CPU, and battery consumption. Our findings unveil methods that require almost no adaptations and run relatively fast as well as methods that could not be deployed due to excessive use of memory. We hope our effort provides a guide to developers and researchers interested in exploring sentiment analysis as part of a mobile application and can help new applications to be executed without the dependency of a server-side API. We also share the Android API that implements all the 14 sentiment analysis methods used in this paper. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Android; Mobile; Performance evaluation; Sentiment analysis","Application programming interfaces (API); Data mining; Mobile devices; Online systems; Social networking (online); Android; Battery consumption; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile environments; Performance evaluation; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Android (operating system)","J.

On the basis of this foundational work, its aim is to systematically link theories of social groups and organizations, on the one hand, and social science game and interaction theory, on the other hand. Rule system theory has contributed to significant features of group theory and social science game theory. It is a cultural-institutional approach to conceptualizing group systems and games. We explore how groups and their particular games can be effectively described, analyzed, and compared—and their similarities and differences identified on a systematic basis. For illustrative purposes, we present a selection of several ideal types of groups: a military unit, a terrorist group, a recreational or social group, a research group, and a business entity, each of whom has a distinct rule configuration making for particular “rules of the game” and game patterns of interaction and outcome. © 2017 by the authors.

The recovery of 16 secondary cremation deposits within a single mound allows an in-depth discussion of spatial aspects of mortuary practices. A spatial division in the placement of the interments adds another level of duality to the mortuary landscape, which comprises: (1) paired mound and enclosures, (2) twin mounds within a mound and enclosure, and (3) the dual division in the mound interior. The multiple levels of nested asymmetric dualism evoke similarities to the moiety system that characterizes modern southern Jê groups, highlighting both the opposition and the complementarity of the social system. The findings offer deeper insight into fundamental aspects of southern proto-Jê social organization, including the dual nature of the community, the manifestation of social structure in the landscape, and its incorporation into mortuary ritual. The results have implications for research design and developing appropriate methodologies to answer culture-specific questions. Furthermore, the parallels among archaeology, ethnohistory, and ethnography enable an understanding of the foundation of modern descendent groups and an assessment of the continuity in indigenous culture beyond European contact.

We hypothesize that social support increases the ability to manage hypertension and Type 2 (T2) diabetes, regardless of place of residence. We also investigate if differences in country of residence and health system factors influence the ability to manage chronic conditions. Older adults 65 years or older from Los Angeles (LA) and Mexico City (CDMX), with diagnosed hypertension or T2 diabetes (self-reported), attending government agencies, participated in the study. The statistical analyses investigate differences between older adults in LA and CDMX; identify the association between social support and chronic disease self-management; and examine the role of T2 diabetes treatment, testing and complications on self-management. Our study findings show that social support was a statistically significant predictor of improved T2 diabetes self-management (37%–51%, p < 0.05). The association between social support and hypertension self-management was only significant (90% confidence level) for adherence to weight management and increased alcohol consumption. Our study did not identify statistically significant differences in social support between LA and CDMX. However, almost 40% of sampled older adults were at risk of social isolation, signaling a vulnerable population that needs to be targeted by health and social systems in the U.S. and Mexico. Our study also shows that social support is a strong predictor of improved T2 diabetes management in the U.S. and Mexico. While older adults in the U.S. and Mexico reported similar access to care and health insurance coverage, higher adherence to low salt diets in LA and reduced coverage of glucose testing in CDMX could signal areas of opportunity for policymakers. Health care providers in both countries need to identify ways of improving adherence to physical activity and weight management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diabetes mellitus; Hypertension; Mexican-American; Older adults; Self-management for chronic disease; Social support","Aged; Chronic Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Los Angeles; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Self Care; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; California; Federal District [Mexico]; Los Angeles [California]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; United States; adult; diabetes; health care; hypertension; management; physical activity; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; body weight management; controlled study; female; government; health care personnel; health care policy; human; hypertension; male; Mexican American; Mexico; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physical activity; population research; risk factor; self care; self report; social isolation; social support; United States; California; chronic disease; ethnology; hypertension; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; procedures; psychology; questionnaire","A.V.

Temporal aspects of energy initiatives and their impacts are thus an important site for examining emergent public views on new energy proposals, inequality, and energy justice. We propose urgency is a particularly rich concept through which to study (i) the justice and socioenvironmental implications of energy systems and technological change and (ii) how people make sense of contested energy timeframes. Here, we present findings from a series of public deliberation workshops held in the United States and United Kingdom to discuss projected impacts of shale oil and gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing. We encountered critical similarities across sites, as in widespread public resistance to issue framings that foreground urgency-based claims in support of their objectives. Participants assessed energy initiatives with particular reference to temporality and urgency, and we argue these views raise justice concerns regarding distribution, the creation of environmental inequalities, public participation, and recognition. We also suggest a focus on urgency provides fresh perspectives on justice issues surrounding the speed and direction of technological development in general and of energy transitions in particular. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy justice; Energy transitions; Fracking; Shale development; Temporality; Urgency","","B.H.

After a policy of grassland contracts was implemented on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, two grassland management patterns evolved: the multi-household management pattern (MMP) and the single-household management pattern (SMP). Within a resilience-driven perspective, this study compared the outcomes of these grassland management patterns by measuring their effects on the resilience of grazing, ecological, economic and social systems. Resilience indicators for each of the four systems were: grazing system (grazing space, transhumance, water source and reproduction); ecological system (vegetation including cover, biomass, species richness and soil properties including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus); economic system (income, expenditure and infrastructure) and the social system (health, assistance, social relations, cultural inheritance and institutional arrangements). In order to provide a social-ecological resilience framework for the two grassland management patterns, a decision support tool was applied to approximately gauge the resilience of each indicator. The results showed that each of the four systems under the MMP had a greater degree of resilience than the SMP, and that the overall resilience of the MMP was estimated at 5.8 units compared to about −5.8 units for the SMP. The relative success of the MMP was seen to rest largely on the maintenance of traditional management practices, social networks, trust and the low cost and high efficiency of informal institutions, which acted to reduce the risk of unsustainable development of ecological and social systems. The important take-home lesson from this study is that contracting of grasslands to private entities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and in the rest of the world where similar land management practices exist, must be undertaken with caution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Land use policy; Multi-household management pattern; Resilience; Single-household management pattern; Social-ecological system","China; Gansu; Maqu; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; comparative study; decision making; decision support system; grassland; land management; land use planning","Q.

It contends that, notwithstanding important differences, both traditions concur in addressing crises as a form of self-reproduction of social systems as much as a form of engagement with the complexities and effects of such processes of reproduction. In order to make our comparison exhaustive, this article explores critical and systems theories’ notions of crisis at three levels: (1) their conceptual delimitation of crises; (2) their methodological proposals to empirically observe crises; and (3) their normative attempts to contribute to their resolution. As crises remain a distinctive structural feature of the social world and a rich source of knowledge about it, reflexivity must be seen as a crucial form of engagement with the negative expressions of social life itself. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","contradictions; crisis; critical theory; paradoxes; reflexivity; systems theory","","R.

The research proposes a dynamic hypothesis that explains that unintended behavioural pattern as a result of delayed balance feedback loops shaped by decision-making processes of actors that intend to control crime. This system matches a well-known systemic archetype that explains those persistent oscillations. The paper also introduces a simulation model for testing that dynamic hypothesis and for delivering concrete courses of action. This work illustrates the relevance for policymakers to understand the dynamic complexity of social systems as the outcome of the agency of actors who take action to defend their own interests. Such actions ultimately form a complex web of interactions that drive the performance of such systems with unintended consequences. In particular, the construction of explicit models provides better chances of devising policies that consider the system-level implications of those interactions. Design/methodology/approach: This work uses system dynamics modelling. First, the paper presents a conceptual model anchored in operational thinking, which refers to the identification of actors and decisions, and the manner in which those decisions ultimately build the respective social system in which the oscillatory pattern emerges. Second, it identifies key feedback structures that result from those chains of decisions. Finally, the paper introduces a simulation model for suggesting policy implications for decisionmakers. Findings: The increasing oscillatory pattern that prison overcrowding in Colombia has displayed over the last 20 years is the outcome of a wide variety of laws that increase sanctions on criminal conducts, a phenomenon known as “legislative inflation”. Such reactions against crime are propelled and sustained by society and policymakers as the result of static and linear thinking that simply delivers “more punishment” of crime – harsher legislation and longer prison terms – which ultimately boosts long-term prison overcrowding and further cycles of crime control and overcrowding. Such actions create permanent negative feedback loops that involve various material and information delays, which – coupled with the reinforcing feedback loops – explain the previously mentioned behavioural pattern. Through a system dynamics simulation model, this paper tests and explains the proposed dynamic hypothesis and shows how policymakers can enhance and develop their dynamic understanding to explore and design effective policies intended to tackle prison overcrowding. Practical implications: This paper presents a practical and concrete case that bridges the fields of criminal policy and prison management through systems thinking. It uses the case of prison overcrowding in Colombia to demonstrate the relevance of incorporating systemic thinking into the cognitive portfolio of policymakers if they aspire to improve complex systems. Originality/value: Criminal policy and prison management are different fields that typically belong to different traditions (law and criminal psychology for the former, public administration for the latter). The work presented here bridges those perspectives under a single engineering and systemic perspective that answers questions in both fields and serves as a unifying framework for designing more coherent criminal policies that meet the practical requirements and restrictions that prison management implies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Complexity; Crime; Criminal policy; Justice; Prison overcrowding; Public policy; Simulation; System dynamics","Cognitive systems; Concretes; Crime; Decision making; Prisons; Public administration; Public policy; System theory; Complexity; Decision making process; Design/methodology/approach; Justice; Simulation; System Dynamics; System dynamics modelling; System dynamics simulation; Feedback","C.

The turn of the same is the emphasis placed on their distinction as a contribution to the debate of their prevalence in the future of societies. To clarify this, a brief intellectual exploration was proposed on both notions in the attempt to explain its scope. Some of the concepts that were analyzed in order to explain their incidence within the social system and to understand its logic of intervention are: cybernetics, technological platform, media ecology, digital division, globalization, and identity. The conclusions reached after the analysis restate the importance of considering the knowledge society, rather than the information society, with the limitations of which it is the object, as a structuring element of the social system. © 2018 Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada.

Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism, filtered by the Habermasian theory, allow us to affirm that it represented a civilizatory revolution, which established a new organisational principle of the social system, capable of overcoming the crisis of late capitalism’s legitimacy, modifying both its objective limits (financialization) and the subjective dimension of motivation (homo œconomicus). However, after 2008 we can say that neoliberalism, whose model is pyramidal and undermines the foundations of the welfare state, has not succeeded it its task of naturalising the crisis and avoiding democracy. It has nonetheless debilitated the public sphere: in the European context, a psychic material of individuals socialised in neoliberalism express their existential restlessness in an expressive and unreflective way, far from the ideal of communicative discursive ethics, through populism. Those concerns are partly fuelled by the problem of public debt, which is at the centre of the mediation between the subjective life and the objective political economy. The imbalances it causes (about which Kant already warned us) generates anti-federal impulses, in a low intensity Schmittianism. To redirect those impulses towards a peaceful federation of European states (the Kantian project) is the political task of the present. © 2018, European Papers-A Journal on Law and Integration.

As a result, they can be regarded as complex social systems, which to some extent are characterized by, and are a source of, inequalities. By analysing the issue of inequality from a socio-spatial perspective, this article aims to show that the post-industrial city is changing insofar as social and spatial disparities are increasing on the basis of income and political influence. The article consists of two parts. The first addresses the issue of inequality and the city, providing a review of the literature on the relationship between social and spatial inequalities. The second is empirical, focusing upon the city of Porto and exploring several intersecting ideas related to the selective processes of de-concentration (or suburbanization) of people and activities, and the way they shape the separation of classes across geographical space. The results confirm the initial hypotheses of increasing socio-spatial inequality in Porto, in a context in which public policies are not geared towards the goal of mitigating socio-economic disparities, but are shaped inversely by consolidated economic ones. © 2016 Intellect Ltd Dossier.","Housing; Inequality; Planning; Porto; Portugal; Social polarization","","S.

Since it was a word initially brought by the Portuguese to the Indian world, it is relevant to ask whether the Portuguese played an important role in its transformation into such a relevant social category. Six of the most important sixteenth-century narratives about the Portuguese presence in India as well as treatises, letters, legal documents, vocabularies and dictionaries of the early-modern period will be under scrutiny in order to identify the variations of the word ""casta"", its circulation in Estado da India, and beyond it. The analysis of these sources will also permit an understanding of how Portuguese colonial experience shaped the future meanings of ""casta"", and therefore, the ways ""casta"" shaped Indian society (and not only).","(Author) Power; (Thesaurus) Caste; Colonialism; India; Language development; Portuguese empire","","Â.B.

Since then, the image of Portugal as a country simultaneously old and new, (post) modern and traditional was used by several social scientists in various fields of research (migration, urban studies, social policy, education, culture). In spite of the remarkable process of modernization the country has experienced during this period of time, inequalities and dualisms continue to be deeply embedded in the economic and social system and were even intensified by recent austerity measures in the context of massive unemployment and economic distress. In the article, I examine two specific domains where signs of dualism(s) persist, the labour market and the system of welfare, and investigate how the interconnectedness between the two is generating new forms of social and economic inequalities. Reforms in the labour market have been under constant reform within the last decades, representing, for a large and increasing number of individuals, more precarious working conditions, low paid jobs, unstable lives with intermittent careers. At the same time, governmental policies have contributed to diminish the level of social protection for labour market participants in precarious employment as well as for people without jobs. This article aims at providing a contribution to the literature on dualization focusing on the link between changing forms of integration in the labour market and transformations in the social protection system, examining its specific configuration in one of the countries belonging to the Southern European welfare regime. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Dual society; Inequality; Insiders; Labour market; Outsiders; Social protection","Portugal; labor market; modernization; unemployment","C.

This quantitative research paper analyzes how young people use online and offline tools to publicize and support “2.0 causes”. Digital communication can facilitate cooperation and solidarity toward certain social initiatives that require active mobilization. However, the competitive advantage that technology can offer is greatly influenced by numerous variables (empathy, closeness, identification with the cause, etc.). It is essential to become familiar with the desires of young people and to find the best ways to gain their attention in order to help them achieve their goals of social commitment. The results of this research suggest that the factors mobilizing young people when they participate in solidarity movements are purely rational and emotional, with less emphasis being placed on the creativity of the campaign, the organization that promotes the action, or the presence of famous prescribers or influencers.

I argue that as a normative model this theoretical matrix seems to resonate with aspects of Adorno’s negative dialectics between subject and object and that the involuntary promise it contains could be fully realized only under other social conditions.

These data are required to gain a better understanding of both physical and social systems; why disease occurs where it does, and how to disrupt it. While data options exist, including high resolution aerial imagery, remotely sensed data, and even online mapping products like Google Street View, these all come with limitations. One option that has previously been utilized to assess cholera risk is spatial video. Here it is used to map potential mosquito breeding sites in an endemic Dengue and Chikungunya, and emerging Zika impacted community. We show how this method can provide mapping support in the hands of non-specialist public health workers who, working in collaboration with out-of-area geographic information systems (GIS) teams, can identify where to target limited intervention resources. We use a case study of an impoverished informal style Nicaraguan community suffering from a high disease burden to show spatial variation in potential mosquito breeding habitats. A field team collected street-by-street spatial video data to produce fine scale risk maps of standing water and trash locations, which, when interpreted with the associated spatial video imagery, were used to suggest where intervention strategies should be targeted. We also discuss how these same data layers can be used to address other health concerns traditionally found in informal settlements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dengue; GIS & health; Informal settlement; Nicaragua; Spatial video; Zika","Nicaragua; breeding site; decision making; GIS; health risk; informal settlement; mapping; mosquito; public health; viral disease","","","Elsevier Ltd","01436228","","","","English","Appl.

We introduce the concepts of complexity gradient, flow of complexity and complexity attractor as the main pillars of the proposed mechanism. The design of these complexity attractors implies entering the black-box description of the social system to understand its operational dynamics. We use the capabilities approach of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2000) to show how this mechanism can increase the inner complexity of the system to achieve desirable performance vis-a-vis its environment.

Assumed to provide beneficial results to the environment and the conservation of biota, rural abandonment triggers landscape and biotic homogenization and loss of valuable species and habitats. This article focuses on the ecological effects and conservation challenges of shifts in extensive grazing regimes on marginal pastureland of Mediterranean mountains. We conceptualize a navigated socioecological transition toward conservation-oriented management after the collapse of historical land systems. The article provides examples from the LIFE+ project “Higro,” developed in mountainous protected areas in Portugal, of how management for conservation could sustain disturbance-dependent habitats. We argue that actively and regularly managing large habitat areas should be envisaged as a short-term approach to limit the immediate effects of rural abandonment. A gradual integration of conservation targets with other activities in changing rural economies is necessary to foster long-term conservation of species and habitats, building on the link between conservation-oriented habitat management and ecosystem services in rural landscapes. Conservation goals should run alongside recovery of social systems and innovation applied to traditional sources of income. This parallel development would contribute to building up social-ecological resilience by maintaining a diversity of social and ecological capital in rural areas. © 2016, by the Rural Sociological Society","","Mediterranean Region; Portugal; conservation management; ecological impact; European Union; Mediterranean environment; mountain region; pastoralism; rangeland; rural landscape; traditional agriculture; transitional economy","","","Rural Sociological Society","00360112","","","","English","Rural Sociol.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978264458"

Using marine protected areas (MPAs) as examples, we argue that MPAs that are carefully designed to fit the existing social systems can be instrumental in synergy building and fostering community development. Such synergy creation is an essential governance strategy that helps enhance governability as it reduces conflicts and provides opportunities for constructive cooperation among stakeholders, especially in times of crisis. We illustrate this using the case of La Restinga MPA in the Canary Islands. Based on data and experiences from long-term research programs on coastal communities in the Canary Islands in general, and La Restinga in particular, we discuss the functions of the MPA in the local contexts and describe how the MPA has transformed relationships and interactions among stakeholders, leading to different levels of synergies. While some of the interactions have not been conducive to the implementation of the MPA, strong synergies have been created, especially after the volcano eruption. The story of La Restinga offers valuable lessons about the way the community copes and responds to change, and the role that synergies play in the process. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coastal tourism; Governability; Marine protected areas; Small-scale fisheries; Sustainable development goals; Synergy","Canary Islands; Hierro; La Restinga; Santa Cruz de Tenerife [(PRV) Canary Islands]; Spain; coastal zone; community development; conservation management; fishery; governance approach; implementation process; marine ecosystem; protected area; research program; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; synergism","J.J.

At the same time, the country's Pacific coast is one of the most biodiverse area on earth. This article aims to examine the institutions involved in the attempts to eliminate the use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in the district of Chocó Colombia, using a novel policy assessment method, that examines the behaviour of actors across the social system. To this end, and taking Law 1658 (the mercury law) as our basis, we used legal instruments to consult with, and question, the centralized and semi-centralized state organizations. We also included the relevant decentralized organizations and the main actor of the alluvial ASM of gold and platinum in our research, through interviews and observation. Conceptualizing institutions as social systems of explicit and tacit rules, our findings provide evidence of stagnation in the state organizations, and of the tendency to underestimate the importance of science, technology, and innovation in mercury elimination. Indeed, the current situation, in which tacit rules are perpetuated and reproduced, is a consequence of the state's inefficiency, allowing the continuation of illegal and underground economic activities by informal organizations and civil society. The article also makes some suggestions for a more positive future direction for Colombia in the context of the ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury and progress towards the formalization of the ASM sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal and small-scale mining; Chocó; Colombia; Economic formalization; Institutions; Law; Mercury-usage; Science; Technology and innovation","","","","Elsevier Ltd","2214790X","","","","English","Extr.

This marked the generalization of skepticism about values. In contrast, the current legal theory called ""post-positivism"" defends the morality of principles as an adequate response to the legal system. Vis-à-vis this scenario, this article seeks to identify the role of skepticism about values in theories about legal interpretation, considering, on the one hand, the description of the positivist theories of Hans Kelsen and Herbert Hart about legal interpretation and, on the other hand, Ronald Dworkin's critique of skepticism and his defense of moral objectivity. This paper aims to answer the question whether the truth about morality can be objective in complex societies so as to limit legal interpretation. After clarifying some conceptual confusion, the work defends that skepticism must be considered a value of the interpretive practice of law in Brazil.","Hermeneutics; Legal interpretation; Legal theory; Skepticism; Value","","M.C.

We employ the evolutionary ontology proposed by Kurt Dopfer for conceiving organized crime as the outcome of social, intelligent agents whose strategies evolve through time. To illustrate the use of this ontology we explore the case of corruption in public procurement processes in Colombia in which criminal organizations—groups of corrupt agents—converge spontaneously. The ontology leads to conceive corruption as a knowledge process that adapts according to the evolution of problem-solving rules that are created, used and discarded by agents that seek to attain personal gains by means of public resources. We also use an engineering perspective that favors model-aided design. We built a simulation model that illustrates how the dynamics of such evolving-rules systems can be conceptualized for exploring potential policies. The application of the evolutionary ontology shows why corruption exhibits self-organization: system-level patterns develop from spontaneous interactions that use only local information. Rule dynamics form a changing structure of rule-populations that adapt to novel environmental conditions and generate meta-stable adaptions that explain why corruption persists despite continuous challenges from the environment. This engineering approach forms the ground for proposing policies that instead of addressing the operant level of a social system (according to observed operations and data), should meet the dynamics of rules that govern those operations. Hence, the role of regulators shifts from “controllers” to inventors of selectionist environments that facilitate suitable change through the introduction or promotion of counter-crime rules, the design of selective pressures that favor the evolution of desirable rules and the attention to coordination gaps at the macro-structure. The recognition of organized crime as the outcome of an evolving-rules system changes the questions that orient policy-making and focuses on the redesign of evolving knowledge. Accordingly, our methodological guidelines address such evolutionary dynamics and can be applied to several forms of organized crime. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer simulation; Corruption; Engineering; Engineering of social systems; Evolution; Policy design; Rule dynamics; Systems","","C.

National states based on national-state citizenship are weaker and weaker before the key challenges of our times. That is why citizenship programs are more and more focused on innovation policies to integrate ius sanguinis, ius soli, citizenship on investment and citizenship on performance. This paper provides a strategic innovation policy by linking development and global citizenship. Innovative law-making, citizenship policy innovation, and development are dramatically interconnected to evolve a scenario in which citizenship represents a key intangible asset to generate tangible wealth in open horizons where free circulation of tangibles or intangibles is strategic and linked to downsizing the bureaucratic burdens, the local power centers by evolving a much leaner and higher organizational standard of citizenship: legally, isotropically, and socially. This results in a new theory of social systems as a useful tool for the management of the complexity of social relations, breaking territorial boundaries, and making them cosmopolitan (Beck, 2006. The cosmopolitan vision. Cambridge: Polity Press). In order to achieve this, the present study will be approached and related with cosmopolitism and development, aiming to bring new contours of study to this subject. © 2018, © 2018 University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.","Citizenship; cosmopolitanism; globalization; innovation; policy making","","S.

We conceptualize sustainability from a social systemic perspective, that is, from a perspective that encompasses the multiple functionalities of a social system and their interrelationships in particular environmental contexts. The systems perspective is applied in our consideration and analysis of disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and sustainable development (SD). Section ""Sustainability and Sustainable Development"" introduces briefly sustainability and sustainable development, followed by a brief presentation of the theory of complex social systems (Section ""Social System Model""). The theory conceptualizes interdependent subsystems, their multiple functionalities, and the agential and systemic responses to internal and external stressors on a social system. Section ""Case Studies of Response to Stressors"" considers disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA), emerging in response to one or more systemic stressors. It illustrates these with disaster risk reduction in the cases of food and chemical security regulation in the EU. CCA is illustrated by initiatives and developments on the island of Gotland, Sweden and in the Gothenburg Metropolitan area, which go beyond a limited CCA perspective, taking into account long-term sustainability issues. Section ""Sustainable Development as a Societal Development System"" discusses the limitations of DRR and CCA, not only their technical limitations but economic, socio-cultural, and political limitations, as informed from a sustainability perspective. It is argued that DRRs are only partial subsystems and must be considered and assessed in the context of a more encompassing systemic perspective. Part of the discussion is focused on the distinction between sustainable and non-sustainable DRRs and CCAs. Section ""Concluding Remarks"" presents a few concluding remarks about the importance of a systemic perspective in analyzing DRR and CCA as well as other similar subsystems in terms of sustainable development. © 2017 by the author.","CCA; DRR; Multi-factor model; Sustainable development; Systems theory","Goteborg; Gotland; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; European Union; social development; sustainability; sustainable development","T.R.

The data sources used for estimating public expenditure on disability are included in two different functional classifications: European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) and Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG). Relating to the ESSPROS classification it is important to consider the specific expenditure on disability compared to the total expenditure on social protection, both of which referred to all public and private entities as a whole. While from the COFOG classification is concerned our interest will be the spending on social protection with exclusive reference to the public sector. The analyzed period is 2005 - 2013, which allows us to study the evolution from the years before the economic crisis to the latest available data. In the first place, estimates for public expenditure in absolute terms have been worked out for each country. Subsequently, in order to facilitate the comparison between the different countries, two relativizations are proposed. In absolute terms, the countries with highest standards of welfare states stand out as those with the highest expenditure on social protection, mainly the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Holland and Denmark) followed by the United Kingdom and those belonging to the continental model such as France, Germany and Italy, while the lowest expenditure occurs in the countries of Eastern Europe. Regarding the overall expenditure on disability, the countries that make up the continental group (Belgium, Germany, France, Austria) are the ones with the highest values, being at some distance from Italy, Sweden and Spain. At the other extreme, Malta, Cyprus, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are the countries with the lowest public expenditure on disability. In order to establish a comparative analysis among the resources allocated by the considered countries for disability care, in addition to estimate absolute values, two relative estimations will be taken: the first referred to the number of disabled persons in each country and the second considering the total amount of public expenditure, in terms of National Accounting (""Uses"" in ESA 2010 terms). The latter of these measures is easily accessible and its determination is out of dispute. However if we expect to use as a reference the number of disabled people in each country we will need to square the figures to a common definition of disability for every country, definition which does not really exist in Europe. The Preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), ratified by the EU in 2010, acknowledges that disability is ""an evolving concept"", but also stresses that ""disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others"". Defining disability as an interaction means that ""disability"" is not an attribute of the person. Progress on improving social participation can be made by addressing the barriers which hinder persons with disabilities in their day to day lives. Taking this into account, it has been applied the criteria of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, World Health Organization, 2001), according to which, persons with disabilities are those who face barriers to participation associated mainly with a health problem or basic activity limitation of activity proposing three levels of basic limitation of disability, each determined by adding up life areas where a person face barriers. (Life domain 1, 2 and 4) Individually approached, the highest ratio values are found in Luxembourg, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Denmark, Italy and France, countries with a high developed model of welfare state. The smallest figures belong to Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, countries which are redesigning their social policies. In the case of Luxembourg, the high value is mainly due to the low number of registered disabled people rather than a real high expenditure. Conversely, the case of the United Kingdom is significant for the low value of the ratio due to the high number of disabled people recorded. As a second option for the relativization of public expenditure on disability, our proposal consists in calculating for each country the amount of expenditure on disability with regard to total public expenditure. This new ratio will allow us to determine the relative importance that each country ascribes to disability in budgetary terms, with the pertinent implications about the social policy of the country considered. In 2012 and 2013, for all EU countries, public expenditure on disability accounted for 2.83% and 2.87%, respectively, of total public expenditure spent by public administrations. The countries with the highest percentage during these two years are Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland and Croatia. In general, the countries that make the greatest budgetary effort in spending on disability are those with a higher expenditure per person, although there are some specific deviations, such as Austria, France and Italy, which, unlike UK, disclose a very small number of people with disabilities. Those countries with the lowest proportions regarding disability spending on total public expenditure are Cyprus, Greece, Malta and Ireland, all of which have budgetary and financial problems. In Spain public spending on disability accounted for 2.53% of total expenditure in 2012 and 2.74% in 2013, standing at the average rate. To sum up, the following conclusions can be drawn in regard of (regarding to) the relative figures in public expenditure on disability: - The countries with the highest values in both ratios are Luxembourg, Sweden, Finland and Denmark - The countries with the lowest values in the both analysis are Cyprus, Latvia and Slovakia. - Spain presents intermediate values on public expenditure per person with disability so as in percentage for the total public expenditure. - Overall, the countries that make a greater budgetary effort in spending for disability, are those that present a higher expenditure per person and have the most developed social systems. - There are countries presenting some specific deviations, such as Austria, France and Italy, which, unlike UK, have a very small number of people with disabilities, a fact which would explain how they show a high public expenditure per person and a small weight of this expenditure compared to Total public expenditure. - The countries with the highest expenditure are the Nordic countries known for their well-developed welfare state models, while the countries with the lowest public spending are the Eastern European countries, in the process of restructuring their social policies. This approach to the measurement of public spending on disability gives a greater visibility of the public attention to disability in Europe and permits the comparability between the countries of our economic environment.","Classification of the functions of government (COFOG); Disability; European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESSPROS); Public expenditure; Social protection","","S.M.

However there is poor understanding about the way that these systems would be impacted by future climatic change on a regional scale. In this context, the need of a multidisciplinary approach in the climate change effects assessment arises as imperative. The design and implementation of the Eco-social Observatory of Climate Change Effects for High Altitude Wetlands of Tarapacá Region is presented here. Since 2013, the Observatory has been gradually implemented by the Centro de Estudios de Humedales in four high altitude wetlands from northern Chile, including two salt lakes and associated springs (Salar del Huasco: 20° 18' S-68° 50' W, 3800 masl; and Laguna Lagunillas: 19° 56' S-68° 51' W, 4100 masl), one high altitude fertile plaine (Copaquire: 20° 55'S-68° 53' W, 3,500 masl), and one ravine wetland (Iquiuca-Parca: 20° 01' S-69° 13' W, 2,500 masl). The Observatory is monitoring variables of the physical, biotic and social components of the environment, integrating different sources of knowledge from natural and social sciences. The understanding of climate change effects on natural and social systems will help to generate better predictions of their effects, providing new tools to design more efficient adaptation strategies in face of future climate change.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Fertile plaine; Indicators; Long-term trends; Monitoring; Multidisciplinary approach; Puna; Salt lakes","","","","Universidad de Tarapaca","07162278","","","","Spanish","Dialogo Andino","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036572641"

Problem • This situation explains why it is so difficult to come up with a general definition of constructivist epistemology that could serve as a starting point to study its several research programs systematically and comparatively. Method • We compare the constructivist epistemologies of Jean Piaget, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Humberto Maturana, and Niklas Luhmann regarding tensions between knowledge/reality and individual/society. Results • Our comparison leads to a general definition of constructivist epistemology as a heterogeneous movement problematizing certain dualities-such as subject/object, knowledge/reality, or individual/society-that have been shown to be central for epistemological inquiry. We argue that such dualisms can be used as dimensions for critical analysis, comparison, and discussion among the different research programs, and that, at the same time, they would allow us to analyze the general strategies characterizing such programs. The comparative and critical analysis of the programs by way of the aforementioned tensions results in an organized presentation highlighting their convergences, divergences, and singularities. Implications • The framework presented for evaluation (and further elaboration) can be useful to elucidate the standpoints of constructivist epistemology's research programs, and thence consolidate lines of dialogue among them. © 2018 Vrije Universiteit Brussel.All Recived.","Constructivism; Epistemology; Knowledge; Reality; Society","","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","1782348X","","","","English","Constr.

Its ambiguous nature is mainly due to the existence of a number of different ways of approaching the subject. Some see it as being derived from an institutional procedure that is bound to formal justice with a material foundation, while others see it as deriving from individual behavior bound to ethics and morality. From this perspective, the topic demands a number of questions. When one talks of social justice, what precisely are the questions involved? What are its constituent elements? At what point can one state that a person or institution is just or unjust, fair or unfair? In other words, when is an individual aware or able to state categorically that the events of his/her daily life do indeed reflect a fair social system? These and other questions are of the utmost importance when one moves ahead in the debate regarding the management and implementation of public policies aimed at achieving a high level of social justice.

In this paper, we attempt to answer this key question by suggesting the role for cities on how we coordinate seemingly chaotic decisions. We look into these elementary processes exploring a particular concept: ""social entropy"", or how social systems deal with uncertainty and unpredictability in the transition from individual actions to systems of interaction. We examine the following conditions: (i) actions rely on informational differences latent in their environments, (ii) the city itself is an information environment to actions, and we propose that (iii) space becomes a form of creating differences in the probabilities of interaction. We investigate this process through simulations of distinct material scenarios to find that space is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the reduction of entropy. Finally, we suggest that states and fluctuations of entropy are a vital part of social reproduction, and reveal a deep connection between social, informational and spatial systems. © Editora CHAMPAGNAT.

A new education paradigm is emerging to address this need, and it takes its cue from the life sciences—biomimicry, ecosystem studies, permaculture and the like, and from the sciences of complexity—complex adaptive systems theory, second order cybernetics, social systems dynamics and the emerging field of systemic innovation. This article explores both the pressures for such a new paradigm of education, tracing their sources to contemporary dynamics in society and environment, and outlines of the new paradigm in education that is emerging in various parts of the world.

Two distinct independent initiatives in Sociology are presented: One, a systems approach, social systems game theory (SGT), and the other, Erving Goffman's interactionist approach (IGT). These approaches are presented and contrasted with classical theory. They focus on the social rules, norms, roles, role relationships, and institutional arrangements, which structure and regulate human behavior. While strategic judgment and instrumental rationality play an important part in the sociological approaches, they are not a universal or dominant modality of social action determination. Rule following is considered, generally speaking, more characteristic and more general. Sociological approaches, such as those outlined in this article provide a language and conceptual tools to more adequately and effectively than the classical theory describe, model, and analyze the diversity and complexity of human interaction conditions and processes: (1) complex cognitive rule based models of the interaction situation with which actors understand and analyze their situations; (2) value complex(es) with which actors operate, often with multiple values and norms applying in interaction situations; (3) action repertoires (rule complexes) with simple and complex action alternatives-plans, programs, established (sometimes highly elaborated) algorithms, and rituals; (4) a rule complex of action determination modalities for actors to generate and/or select actions in game situations; three action modalities are considered here; each modality consists of one or more procedures or algorithms for action determination: (I) following or implementing a rule or rule complex, norm, role, ritual, or social relation; (II) selecting or choosing among given or institutionalized alternatives according to a rule or principle; and (III) constructing or adopting one or more alternatives according to a value, guideline, or set of criteria. Such determinations are often carried out collectively. The paper identifies and illustrates in a concluding table several of the key differences between classical theory and the sociological approaches on a number of dimensions relating to human agency; social structure, norms, institutions, and cultural forms; patterns of game interaction and outcomes, the conditions of cooperation and conflict, game restructuring and transformation, and empirical relevance. Sociologically based game theory, such as the contributions outlined in this article suggest a language and conceptual tools to more adequately and effectively than the classical theory describe, model, and analyze the diversity, complexity, and dynamics of human interaction conditions and processes and, therefore, promises greater empirical relevance and scientific power. An Appendix provides an elaboration of SGT, concluding that one of SGT's major contributions is the rule based conceptualization of games as socially embedded with agents in social roles and role relationships and subject to cognitive-normative and agential regulation. SGT rules and rule complexes are based on contemporary developments relating to granular computing and Artificial Intelligence in general. © 2018 by the authors.","Agency; Classical and sociologically inspired game theories; Game transformation; Institutions; Norms; Open games; Roles; Rule regimes; Social structure","","T.R.

Method: qualitative study in which twelve young people were interviewed through a theoretical sampling, and were contacted by the ""snowball"" technique, and others were interviewed in a treatment center. Results: For young people to study and then work is not a life expectancy, everyone from his experience and individuality recognize that unemployment is not a free condition, chosen or circumstantial; their discourses show a complex phenomenon of the social system where the crisis of institutions (family, school, work) leaves young people in a vulnerability situation, excluded and exposed to risks such as drug use. Conclusions: The social exclusion of young people is derived from the crisis of institutions, where drug use may be a catalyst to give meaning to their lives, favoring segregation and marginalization. © Health and Addictions 2016.","Alcohol abuse; Drug use; Marginalized youth; Unemployed youth; Young people who neither study nor work","","V.P.

The notion of modern social systems or institutions as structures of impartial, neutral, formal and impersonal proceduralism with a technical-logical or instrumental sense, constitution and evolution implies their non-political and non-normative understanding, depoliticizing them. As a consequence, institutions (especially political and economic ones) become self-referential and self-subsisting structures-subjects which are centralized and managed by institutional elites and technicians from a technical- logical standpoint-dynamics. We argue that a model of radical political democracy must overcome such separation between cultural modernity and social-economic modernization, politicizing the social systems and making them normative-political institutions- subjects streamlined and defined by social struggles between conflicting social classes, their hegemony and counterpoints. © 2019, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana.","Modernization; Proceduralism; Radical Democracy; Strong Institutionalism","","","","Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana","01044443","","","","English","Rev.

The human being is placed at the centre of the theoretical model, and as a logical consequence, findings have been oriented towards describing the positive or negative effects of the phenomenon on society and the individual. Without discarding the validity or necessity of these perspectives, whose genesis and evolution we address synthetically and diachronically, we propose to improve on them in order to better understand the functioning of cyberspace. To do this, we will apply to the study of cyberspace the systemic approach of Niklas Luhmann, who proposes going beyond anthropocentrism, which he considered to be an “epistemological obstacle”, to use Gaston Bachelard’s definition. For Luhmann the characteristic element of social systems was not individuals, but communications. By applying this new paradigm, we will consider whether cyberspace complies with the central features of social systems or if whether it functions like a social environment. In the conclusions, we will observe that cyberspace is in part a system and in part an environment; in other words, what we would call a social hypersystem. It is a communication system that is autonomous and self-produced technologically, but it is, at the same time, the environment of the social system, representing in itself the possibility of increasing its complexity. © 2018 Communication & Society.","Bachelard; Communication theory; Cyberspace; Luhmann; Social system; Technology","","","","Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Navarra","02140039","","","","English","Comun.

In this work we discuss groundwater-management as an example of these Coupled Socio-ecological System, also known as Coupled Human and Natural Systems. We argue that it is possible and even necessary to construct a contextual statistical theory of groundwater management. Contextuality implies some very different statistical features as entanglement and complementarity. We discuss some interpretation about statistical entanglement and statistical complementarity in terms of groundwater flow theory and extraction equation. To this end, we propose a non-Kolmogorobian approach following the Växjö school of thought. One of the most straightforward conclusions is that in this way, a statistical-contextual treatment of groundwater management may not only give place to new flow equations, but it could have a profound impact in resource management. Then the new basic unity of analysis should be the indivisible pair (users, aquifer). We should not talk any more about aquifer dynamics or resource management plans by themselves. Physical and social systems are coupled in a statistical-contextual fundamental way, and a socio-hydrogeological theory should be developed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Complexity; Contextual statistic; Groundwater; Probability theory; Quantum mechanics","Aquifers; Ecology; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Natural resources management; Probability; Quantum theory; Resource allocation; Statistics; Water management; Water treatment; Complexity; Coupled human and natural systems; Groundwater management; Probability theory; Resource management; Resource management plan; Socio-ecological systems; Statistical features; Groundwater resources","O.

For this purpose, the processes allowing the observation of money as medium of exchange in economy are described. Social sciences deployed their own explanations about money in a wide range of formalists, psychoanalysts, religious, functionalists, culturalists, phenomenological and classic systemic descriptions. Such theories contain implicit observations of macro, meso and micro social formation levels. Based on the state of art on this topic, the place of money in the sociology of Niklas Luhmann is described. The article concludes with a characterization of money as a symbolic medium reaching self-referentiality of the economic system, the bifurcation of money's meanings in organizations, and its emergent properties associated to the dilemma agency/constriction in interaction systems.","Economic system; Interaction system; Money; Social organization; Symbolic medium","","J.

However, despite its importance, this concern does not seem to have gone hand in hand with the consideration of environmental education within the framework of a complex enought sociological theory. As we will argue in this article, this has had important effects in the conceptualization of environmental education, which is hence generally described as a process of ethical socialization with the aim of improving society. Using the distinctions of Luhmann's social systems theory of social systems between a) psychic and social systems and b) different functional systems, we will propose an understanding of environmental education as an intentional effort to socialize about the relationship between society and its physical environment, which, as part of the communications of a specialized system, reflect society's form of differentiation. Once this definition is proposed, we will propose a model of environmental education for a functionally differentiated society, taking Chile as example.

The legislative inflation combined with the law's ineffectiveness contributes to the lack of trustworthiness of constituted powers, particularly of Executive and Legislative House, based on a perception of State actions legitimacy towards its citizens. Within this context, the Judiciary arises as the leading actor in moral, social and political quarrels regarding conflicting matters, with a shift of power around deliberation in the political majority stake, whose players are democratically chosen, for the judges. In this way, several affairs of utmost relevance to the completion of Human Rights are being decided on the sphere of such Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, in lieu of the appropriate political instances, like the Houses of Lords and Commons and the Government. While, in one hand, it is perceived the strengthening of the Judiciary, on the other hand, it is required to establish patterns to the practice of jurisdictional rendering and to the reading of juridical norms related to the materialization of essential rights, in which one can usually ascertain, damages due to the inertia of Public Administration to fulfill and comply with the prescriptive provisions or, with the intentional negligence on legislating around polemic matters, to avoid the strain, as observed in the case of therapeutic frontloading of anencephalic fetuses' labour or same sex marriage. Therefore, we do intend, via Niklas Luhmann's The System Theory, establish the existing connections between the Law and Politics, in order to outline patterns to the judicial empowerment, which legitimates the judicial decisions on the area of Fundamental Rights' substantiation.","""judicialization"" of politics; Judicial activism; Social systems","","","","Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos","21752168","","","","Portuguese","Rev.

Parting from a critical revision of classic perspectives oriented by the dogmatic affirmation of fundamental rights and the institutional tradition derived from sociological observation, these rights perform a dual function. They are responsible for the structuring of normative expectations and, at the same time, they construct internal dogmatic limits within the system. Through the contributions of phenomenology and social systems theory, this model suggests autonomous spheres of fundamentality in contrast to the classical unity of fundamental rights. Furthermore, the balancing schemes are substituted for an internal “law of collision.” Conflict resolution undergoes a shift from the traditional method to the system’s reflexive pragmatics, contributing to the legal security and the democratic legitimacy of judicial review. Finally, it verifies how this theory could be applied to the advent of the Zika virus which affected Brazil from 2015 to 2017. As the Zika virus crisis involves different spheres of fundamentality, entailing a range of systems of law and therefore revealing different collision patterns, this essay demonstrates how this new approach could contribute to the control of solutions. © 2018, University of Tyumen.

Villa, which is set in the shanty town Villa 21, emphasizes the dynamism and liveliness of public spaces, and refers to residents' solidarity. In contrast, Diagnóstico esperanza is set in the social housing complex Carlos Gardel and focuses on a verbally violent single-parent household. Even though both films denounce the marginalization of the urban poor, Villa ultimately celebrates the qualities of shanty town space, while Diagnóstico esperanza complicates the relationship between people and their lived environment, radically questioning the idea of what constitutes a functional society. Thus, both films are revealed to be antithetical to the very notion of 'home' that the state once intended to impose, albeit in different ways. © Institute of Modern Languages Research 2018.","César González; determinism; Diagnóstico esperanza; Ezio Massa; shanty towns; social housing; space; Villa","","A.L.

Cultural expressions of the social conflicts associated with such problems are the result of human interventions in ecosystems. These interventions respond to the need to transform into natural resources a segment of the elements that are part of these ecosystems, using socially organized processes of work and using complex technologies and procedures, corresponding to the social relations prevailing in society that use these resources. The reorganization of nature resulting from these interventions, in turn, generates transformations in the social structures and mentalities of human groups. In this way, by modifying the natural systems upon which human beings depend for their existence, it opens the way, usually without knowing or desiring it, to the formation and development of contradictions in the social systems on which their organization depends as a species and the processing of such systems. According to the degree of development of each society, this process can be limited to a purely local scale or reach a planetary scale, both in its direct results and in the projection of its consequences on ecosystems and distant social forms of life. In this sense, the visions of the natural world and their corresponding behaviors, that is, the environmental culture of each society express both the internal relations between the groups that integrate it and those that it maintains with the other societies. Thus, the view of any particular element of the ecosystems present in the environment of society is determined in time and space by the changes that occur both in relation to the value of this element for the life of its members, and the function it can fulfill in its relations with the other human groups with which it shares the same territory or with the planet Earth itself. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

They are also the physical scenario where the nature-human interaction is more intense. The explicit relationships that link biodiversity, ES and HWB, and the direct and indirect causes responsible for their degradation, have been rarely explored. We used the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to explore the relationships between the river ecosystem and the Biobío Basin's social system. We selected 65 basin and regional-scale indicators to analyse the existing trends and associations among the different DPSIR components. The trend analysis results showed major biodiversity loss and how the regulating services and non-material goods of the HWB component deteriorated, while cultural services, direct and indirect pressures and institutional responses increased. The relationships among the different DPSIR components revealed biodiversity loss to be positively associated with cultural services, the material goods of the HWB component and pressures. Indirect drivers were negatively associated with regulating and cultural services, non-material goods and pressures. Institutional responses did not correlate with any DPSIR component. However, these results do not reflect the complexity of the Biobío Basin's socio-ecosystem. We estimate that the DPSIR framework shows a corseted and reductionist vision of a greater complexity than merely a unidirectional nature-human relationship. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biobío Basin; Change drivers; DPSIR framework; Ecosystem services; Human well-being","","M.E.

In order to do this, we search through bibliographic and documentary research and use of the deductive method, to deal with systems theory based on Niklas Luhmann and to examine the use of nudges from public policies. Subsequently, the relation between the dignity of the human person and the work is presented, the concept of decent work is presented and a brief contextualization of contemporary slave labor. Finally, we try to verify the reflexes of the state nudges, which for the purposes of this study are limited, Law 14.946 / 2013 (Lei Bezerra) and the “dirty list”, in the behavior and performance of companies regarding compliance of labor laws. The research made it possible to verify that besides nudges to combat contemporary slave labor have the potential to be maximized, the formulation and implementation of policies based on nudge as an incentive, through benefits derived from observance of labor standards and, therefore, promotion of decent work, would be more effective than condemnatory practice.

It starts with a discussion of “transconstitutionalism” and its limits. Transconstitutionalism concerns the fact that multiple legal orders of the same or different kind are simultaneously involved with the same constitutional issue or case, i.e. issue or case concerning basic rights or legal limitation and control of political power. Constitutional problems, thus go beyond the state and entangle several legal orders, although no new constitution arises in this context. The article points out the limits of transconstitutionalism in an asymmetric world society so as to seek new alternatives beyond it. Two alternatives are considered: post-constitutionalism, which demands transcendence of today’s world society and thus negate constitutionalism in general, and transdemocracy, which is rather immanent to our social formation and claims to be complementary to transconstitutionalism. Because the author prefers the second alternative, the article begins to outline an approach to transdemocracy that goes across state boundaries and beyond “We the People”, that is popular sovereignty, in order to emphasize the sustainable responsiveness for other peoples in the same world society. It is a question of sustainability of democracy.

The research is based on 180 records made through interviews, focus groups, observations and documentary collection, involving 190 informants. The data analysis shows that social systems create subordinated and stigmatised conditions of experience for people with disabilities which lead to social exclusion and reification. This understanding of disability as oppression (which is the ‘coffin of the dead’) can be combated by means of education, understood as resistance to inequality. This can be effected by questioning the social order and power relationships, thus striving to produce the possibility of being a subject. In this way Rafael has been able to construct his identity relatively autonomously, challenging social mandates that led him to exclusion and denied his existence as a subject.

Through a critical historical account of so-called rationalisation of life and science, it is recognised that the economic growth model that prevailed over the last few centuries led to a disjunctive dissociation of our social systems from the natural systems, which now figures as a root cause of unsustainability. The same rationalisation arguably provoked the fragmentation of knowledge into more and more specialised disciplines, as part of a scientific framework that cannot now be readily applied to deal with current pressing socioenvironmental problems. It is argued that interdisciplinarity is the only academic response capable of achieving the reintegration of knowledge required to address the sustainability paradigm, as compromises are sought between what is essential, desired and possible, both within and without academia. © 2016, OpenJournals Publishing.

For reconstruction, we identify the theoretical network that Luhmann developed between self-simplifying, action and presentation of itself and analyze, firstly, the evolution of these elements until Social Systems, and secondly its substantive relationship with the communication based on their functional orientation to the problem of the self-description of social systems. For its reformulation we present two hypotheses. The former is a critical hypothesis that calls into question the original formulation of Luhmann due its narrowness, reductionism and restricted. The latter is a propositive hypothesis that suggests a theoretical expansion of self-simplifying in connection with the distinction action/ experience and with the differentiation of attributions. © 2018 Universidad de Chile.

Usually, they are related to the unbalanced growth, characteristic of Capitalism. Therefore, the present crisis was seen to come in the measure that, for time, well-known imbalances exist in real estate and financial sectors. Besides, the financial sector has been placed at the top of the control of the other activities; and neo-liberal doctrines have reduced regulatory capacity of public policies. Considering that this crisis may be indicating the end of a stage, we should not forget Sampedro and his lessons on the importance of the split of inequalities. He was a humanist.

Curricula and degrees have been focused on the needs of the market. The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has promoted the education policies which have been focused mainly in these concerns in the process of convergence of higher education. However, there are few research and studies about competences learning and labor market needs in Higher Education (Foncubierta, Perea & Siles, 2016; Aragón et al., 2015), particularly in the Spanish context and from a pedagogical and educational perspective. Consequently, our aim is to bring us closer to policy actions based on competences model as an impulse to the employability of graduates. For that purpose, we have carried out a qualitative, phenomenological and descriptive study. The information sources used were social agents. As a result, social agents have seen EHEA changes as structural transformations. This perspective is evidencing a certain distance, which translates into a lack of knowledge of the competences of the degree. They demand the need for a greater dialogue between university institutions and society, and a better definition of the professional role. Therefore, we can’t see an awareness raising about the degree value. Even more, we can’t observe a dialogue between the university and society. Thereby, the competences model is not connecting the university with the labor market. It is revealing a break between social agents and higher educational policies. © 2018, Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The predominance of solar and wind sources goes hand in hand with a low terminological clarity, which however allows mass media to build distinct thematic structures around social systems such as economy, science, politics and law. Environmental references are less frequent and shallower, privileging its evocative aspects with maximum linkage capacity. Conclusions. Instead than observing mass media as mere transmitters of rationalities external to them, more attention should be given to their ability to create realities and representing the (human and ecological) environment. © 2017, University of La Laguna.

The purpose of this article is to analyse, specifically, the treatment of conflict that emerges from this conceptual manoeuvre. Our hypothesis is that, although the conflict is formally integrated in this theory, it is weakly explained as it partially recognizes the social conditions that make it viable.

The identification of charcoal as Jacaranda sp. in the western earth ovens matches the moiety associations and suggests a specific use of resources within ritual determined by the dual social system. The results have implications for understanding southern proto-Jê social formation, ritual practice, and resource management, as well as providing a cautionary note for the consideration of cultural formation when designing research questions and methodologies. © 2016","Charcoal; Dualism; Jacaranda; Moiety; Mound and enclosure; PM01; Southern proto-Jê","","M.

It is purposeless to dis­cuss GL subjectively in the face of climate change, without associating it with the meaning of common good. The aim is to discuss GL, taking the interest of future generations into account, from the dialec­tic relationship between subjectivity and common good and the complementarity between human be­ings and nature. This is an essay. The discussion refers to the ecocentric perspective, which suggests that the social system is interconnected with the ecological system, especially when one considers the creation of GL for future generations. GL, more than just material, health and socio-educational conditions, is a particular state of happiness, in which different cultural patterns prevail. One does not deny abstracting economic logic – in which the subject calculates individual consequences, but territorially ignores the common good – and it does not prevail over or even determine production processes and human reproduction, from which arises the emptied subject. Finally, GL cannot be relegated to achievements of other generations, or else to a “cool” way of life, without responsibilities and decontextualized from future generations. Subjectivity and common good can be reconciled in a societal dimension that is not reduced to mere calculation and where human beings do not put aside, nor to others (politics) nor to themselves (psyche), in the production of the eco-socio-eco­nomical path, what makes an associated human life that does not systemically relegate its own process of socialization. © 2017, UNIV SAOPAULO.

The complexities of integrated water resources management (IWRM) and environmental management are particularly fraught with difficulty as they require the application of ecological system theory to social systems in planning, management, and government. Recognizing the critiques of sustainable development, we propose a new method that joins Berke’s terminology social environmental systems (SES) to Ostrom’s sustainability principles in a semi-empirical “thrivability appraisal method,” which brings together long-enduring institutional characteristics with common test methods that point to SES capacity for thriving with equality. The method has been applied to two research areas: the Mount Arrowsmith Biosphere Region on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and the Eighth Hydrographic Region of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Brazilian case addresses water supply, sanitation, and building local capacities for participation in common goods management while the Canadian case examines the commoditization of water and forest resources as the primary barriers to thriving in changing times. Transferability of this new method to similar areas is also discussed. © Common Ground Research Networks, Maria Inês Paes Ferreira, Pamela Shaw, Graham Sakaki, Taylor Alexander, Luis Felipe Umbelino.

In the food system dynamics the understanding of changes and trends is crucial to improve our capacity to deal with the objectives of sustainable development and quality of life. Food system efficiency evaluation is necessary with regard to production and consumption efficiencies as well as market and governance dilemmas. Regulations and institutional efficiency are crucial aspects that are frequently forgotten, and efforts should be made to improve the capacity to deal with those methodological needs. In many situations, in the real world, data and measurements are difficult or even impossible to get in numeric or quantitative terms. Frequently, a qualitative evaluation is the only way to proceed, but measurements and numeric references are still important, mainly when changes over time are central to the research. The actual paper follows a structural food system model (WFSE – World Food Security Equation) and a general equilibrium approach (ICI model – induced changes and innovation model) to show in a country case study (Cape Verde) the important role of markets and institutions as compared to regulation practices directed to improve economic efficiency subject to demand behavior. Cape Verde is a very challenging country with regard to the food security status (where natural resources are very poor for agricultural production) but with great success in global and macro terms in the last 10 years. The main problems nowadays are clearly at local level. The present research tries to highlight the global achievements and explore local assessment efforts on food consumption conditions. A specific region is studied, in the island of Santo Antão, one of the most important production regions. Three different production systems were compared mainly with regard to their respective influence on consumption habits, incomes and global interaction and behavior. The results show that food consumption at local level is reasonable good in terms of food security, but that food habits have a determining and surprising influence. Solutions for “food security” improvements are complex and very dependent on social systems, somehow in line with the problems in industrialized economies. © 2014.

The local, national and international relations impose into these social systems different force fields determining the space of possibilities in which they evolve. In this situation, the decision-making is correspondingly further more complex as to drive democratic participation from the root-level of individual members and stakeholders, all the way through until the global system. eParticipation represents a possibility to make it possible determined by the member perceptions of partaking in relevant decisions. A paradigmatic example of these globalised social structures is the European Higher Education System, in which very well defined local and national structures coexist with a normative field of globalised relations. Between 2010 and 2013 an eParticipation system was developed under EU support involving a significant number of universities from Europe and abroad. A flexible approach was used to adapt the system to the different contexts, whereas an analytical framework was set up to evaluate the experience in order to find guidance for future eParticipation developments. The socio-technical and analytical frameworks and the corresponding results are discussed aiming to propose a new architecture for eParticipation. This solution targets the challenges of the 21st century University in which the crossroads of learning analytics, eAdministration and eParticipation are deeply re-structuring the academic environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision making; eDemocracy; eParticipation; European Higher Education Area; Learning analytics; Subsidiarity","Decision making; E-democracy; E-participation; European Higher Education Area; Learning analytics; Subsidiarity; Education","","","Elsevier Ltd","07475632","","CHBEE","","English","Comput.

My argument is that the way different authors have introduced the structural dimension in governance models derived from this framework, generally fails to take sufficient account of recent developments in the sociological debate on structuration and agency. To do so may lead to a multi-agent institutional analysis perspective, which permits us to question the development of governance structures aimed at the intersectorial regulation of social risks with the participation of state and non-state agents in a more suitable manner. This could improve the explanatory power of the neo-institutional framework by explicitly taking into account the problem of social agency in analyzing the emergence of said governance structures.","Governance; Multi-agent social systems; Neo-institutionalism; Social agency and structuration; Social risks","","A.

Nevertheless different paradigms and disciplines have influenced its development in particular directions. Along the way, what was initially formulated in the natural sciences has come to be embraced enthusiastically by the social sciences and harnessed to already contested concepts, such as community and social capital, as a way of explicating what should be resilient, the conditions and resources thought to foster resilience, and the ways in which resilience can be measured. But this has not occurred unproblematically and there are reasons to be cautious about the uncritical application of resilience thinking to social systems and contexts. Further, while the interest of this collection lies in the concept of rural community resilience, it is important to be mindful that there is nothing uniquely rural about the term since it has also been adopted in the urban context, arguably with even more fervour. It is worth asking, then, what, if anything, is distinct about the theory, policy and practice of rural community resilience and in what ways do rural studies scholars make a contribution to resilience debates that go beyond the immediate setting of rural spaces. © 2015, CEDDAR.

With such formalism, multidimensional dynamical models of discrete complex systems, such as the social systems and ecosystems, can be built. Design/methodology/approach: This formalism is named as discrete multidimensional dynamic system (DMDS). The DMDS provides a way to consider the variation of the density of a state variable with regard to the variables of the change space as a function of multidimensional rates. Multidimensional rates describe this evolution as a consequence of the relation of each multidimensional-point with a given set of other points of the change space. This relation contains the accessibility domains (sets of space points with which each space point is related). Findings: This equation is compared with both the reaction-diffusion equation written in its finite difference form and the cellular-automata model, demonstrating its compatibility with them and an increase in generality, widening the scope of application. The steps to construct models of systems with multidimensional variation based on the equation that defines the DMDS are specified and tested. Research limitations/implications: Through the DMDS and a well-stated methodology, an application case is provided in order to describe the multidimensional demographic dynamics of an urban system. In this case, the numerical evolution of the population density by districts and cohorts is determined by the DMDS based on some hypothesis about functions of population diffusion between the different districts of the system. Originality/value: The scope of application of the space-time dynamic system (STDS), given by the authors in a previous work, has been extended to discrete and multidimensional systems. STDS model produces better results than the reaction-diffusion model in validation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dynamics; Formalism; General systems theory; Multidimensional; Simulation","Diffusion; Diffusion in liquids; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Linear equations; System theory; Design/methodology/approach; Formalism; General systems theory; Multidimensional; Multidimensional dynamic system; Multidimensional variations; Reaction diffusion equations; Simulation; Population statistics","P.D.

The authors concentrate their analysis on social actors, their subjectivity and the practices they bring into play in spaces of interethnic encounters. These interethnic relations are structured by social systems and by historical processes that form and transform them. The case of Chilean Aymara analyzed here corresponds to a reality of recently constituted interethnic relations, with the convergence of colonial history and the modern construction of citizenship. The surge of Aymaran ethnicity, as is also the case with the other Andean first peoples, is closely related to the policy of affirmative action started in the early 1990's by Chilean government agencies. This policy created a recursive link between indigenous actors, who became ethnified, and public agencies, which built policy in relation to these ethnified actors. This explains why the greatest frequency of interethnic relations occur precisely where public officials interact with persons, groups and organizations that self-identify as belonging to first nations. In other social contexts and with other subjects, especially in urban spaces, relations have less interethnic content, and this tends to be less frequent, irregular, contingent or optional.","Chilean aymaras; Ethnic prejudices; Interethnic relations; Spheres of interaction","","","","Universidad de Tarapaca","07161182","","","","Spanish","Chungara","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908454367"

To assess the potential role of local knowledge in our quest to understand better climate change and its impacts, we first need to critically review the strengths and weaknesses of local knowledge of climate change and the potential complementarity with scientific knowledge. With this aim, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of published peer-reviewed documents reporting local indicators of climate change (including both local observations of climate change and observed impacts on the biophysical and the social systems). Overall, primary data on the topic are not abundant, the methodological development is incipient, and the geographical extent is unbalanced. On the 98 case studies documented, we recorded the mention of 746 local indicators of climate change, mostly corresponding to local observations of climate change (40%), but also to observed impacts on the physical (23%), the biological (19%), and the socioeconomic (18%) systems. Our results suggest that, even if local observations of climate change are the most frequently reported type of change, the rich and fine-grained knowledge in relation to impacts on biophysical systems could provide more original contributions to our understanding of climate change at local scale. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Climate models; Biophysical systems; Case-studies; Climate research; Local knowledge; Local observations; Meta analysis; Scientific knowledge; Social systems; climate change; climate modeling; critical analysis; environmental planning; meta-analysis; traditional knowledge; Climate change","V.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Inspired by bacterial conjugation, the authors have defined an artificial society in which agents’ strategies adapt to changes in resources location, allowing migration, and survival in a dynamic sugarscape-like scenario. To study the impact of these variables the authors have simulated a scenario in which resources are limited and localized. The authors also have defined three constraints in genetic information processing (inhibition of plasmid conjugation, inhibition of plasmid reproduction and inhibition of plasmid mutation). Findings – The results affirmed the hypothesis that efficiency of group adaptation to dynamic environments is better when societies are varied and distributed than when they are homogeneous and centralized. Originality/value – The authors have demonstrated that in a model based on free interactions among autonomous agents, optimal results emerge by incrementing heterogeneity levels and decentralization of communication structures, leading to a global adaptation of the system. This organic approach to model peer-to-peer dynamics in complex adaptive systems (CAS) is what the authors have named “bacterial-based algorithms” because agents exchange strategic information in the same way that bacteria use conjugation and share genome. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Autopoiesis; Emergence; Information theory; Intelligent agents; Social systems","","D.

Objectives: This article describes the implementation of a participatory community-based audit of care in obstetric emergencies that was conducted in rural Indonesia. Methods: Four village-based groups were convened to review a series of cases of maternal death and disability and to develop recommendations for health planning. Thematic narrative analysis of the discussion transcripts was employed to describe how participation occurred. Results: Participation was complex and dynamic and evolved over the course of the study. Although blame and defensiveness characterized the early discussions, over time, participants became less condemning of individuals and more so of systems and services, situating individual behaviors within the wider health system context. Participants also increasingly shared personal experiences, generating rich and explicit assessments of care. Eliciting this information was contingent on skillful facilitation, assuring anonymity, and instilling ""permission to criticize"" among the participants. Sufficient time was also required to convey the necessary principles and reassurances. Despite evidence the process had resulted in women and community members being more prepared, informed, and responsive toward obstetric emergencies in villages, the short-term nature of the study meant that implementation and evaluation of the recommendations were not possible. Without a sustained and ongoing approach, the potential for impact, sustainability and empowerment were limited. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that when carefully implemented, CPH can yield rich explanatory accounts of adverse health events, providing unique information for health planning. We recommend the method for routine district health planning, configured as a continuous process characterized by autonomy, authority, and self-reliance, and involving those excluded by health and social systems. Despite its potential and relevance, authentic CPH may be threatened by wider socio-economic and political conditions, as well as by prevailing evidence hierarchies that exist in public health research. We recommend policy and research to establish a firmer foundation for this progressive, yet obscured, public health concept.","Community participation in health; Health equity; Health insurance; Indonesia; Maternal health; Social determinants of health","","","","","15577112","","","","English","Soc.

Firstly, it shall be argued that culture as an operation performs worlds, this is, familiar condensations of diverse situations, entities and functional logics. Secondly, it is proposed that the performation of said worlds depends on material mediations. It is, in consequence, necessary to question the premises of systems theory that reduce the social to sense-based communication. Thus, while social systems theory permits a productive redefinition of the concept of culture, such redefinition leads again to question important premises of this theory.","Actor-network theory; Culture; Diagram; Materiality; Social systems theory; Worlds","","I.

This theoretical move seems to be analogous to Adorno's negative dialectics between subject and object and the involuntary promise it contains could only be fully realised under other social conditions.

Regarding phylogenesis, the focus in Luhmann’s theory was placed on the “pre-linguistic medium of communication” constructed by gestures, which would have been the element that stimulated the evolution of language. This sort of communication allows for the emergence of a certain social order. Here, the problem was the impossibility of identifying this social order by one of the primary forms of societal differentiation. An attempt was made to interpret in which societal contexts pre-language “emerges”. In order to do this, the author resorted to Michael Halliday’s systemic-functional linguistics. Concerning ontogenesis, the attention was directed to the concepts of action and experience. The point of departure was Ilja Srubar’s criticism of Luhmann’s theory of language, according to which the acquisition of language can be thought of as a process of translating action schemes into linguistic ones. This implies a nativist vision of language discarded by Luhmann and also by Halliday. The latter indicated that it is impossible to talk about translating non-linguistic and pre-linguistic cognition schemes into linguistic form because there is no model of experience previous to the linguistic categories. In addition, an attempt was made to show that systemic-functional linguistics can be useful to fill the gap regarding the ontogenesis of language left by Luhmann’s systems theory. © 2015, Croatian Sociological Association.

Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) are typically described as being characterized by male philopatry and female dispersal, with these patterns reflected in stronger affiliative and cooperative relationships among males than among females. Recent findings, however, indicate that male-male relationships may not be as uniformly strong as previously thought, which suggests that male philopatry in spider monkeys may not be universal. Here, we report the first confirmed cases of male immigration and group takeover in spider monkeys. Data were collected on one community of Ateles geoffroyi in northwestern Costa Rica. Behavioral and demographic data were recorded during subgroup follows across 6.5 years, and fecal samples of community members were collected for genetic analysis of relatedness. We documented two separate cases of immigration involving multiple males, which resulted in take-over of the study community by extra-community males and the concomitant disappearance of the resident males. In the study community, males were no more closely related to one another, on average, than females were, contrary to what would be expected if males were the more philopatric sex. Comparison of corrected assignment indices for males and females also revealed no evidence of sex-biased dispersal. Our findings suggest that in spider monkeys male immigration may occur under certain demographic circumstances, contributing to a view of greater flexibility in their social system than previously appreciated. This discovery has implications for other species that are typically characterized by male philopatry. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ateles geoffroyi; dispersal; immigration; male-male relationships; social system","animal behavior; animal society; article; comparative study; feces analysis; female; genetic analysis; human; immigration; male; philopatry; spider monkey","F.

Therefore, first we evaluated the effect generated by agents in terms of productivity. Then, referring to the structural dimension of context of action, we proposed that, in co-authorship networks, both the privileged position of the researchers in terms of structural holes as the factions of the network configuration in the form of small worlds can be one of the elements that enable the agency. The analysis of how social structure influences the behavior and performance of individuals is primarily based on studies of social network analysis, in that even if acknowledging the limitations, it is as fruitful and coherent methodological framework. However, in parallel, multilevel statistical models have been employed. Commonly knowing as hierarchical linear models or HLM models, they seek to evaluate how context affects social action. Given these two possibilities, this study sought to reconcile the network analysis with hierarchical models to assess the agency as socially immersed in networks of relationships. Thus, the scientific field is taken as a type of social system, whose networks of co-authoring relationships are evaluated as structural dimension in terms of position-practice. That’s because there is evidence that the relationship structure interfere both in the process of institutionalization of the shares, as the capacity for agency researchers. We found that the small worlds networks affects the academic productivity both collectively and individually, as well as the presence of structural holes at the individual level. These results point to the importance of assessing the capacity of agency while embed in social networks, since different mechanisms of social capital conditioning the actions. © 2014 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

The neoliberal and neoconservative references, as basic principles of educational policies, take us to a wave of privatization of the public school. Because of that, we analyze these privatization processes, not only studying the ones that are clearly visible (exogenous), like the financing of subsidized private schools and the outsourcing of schools, but also the hidden ones (endogenous). From the consideration that the private practices are more efficient than the public ones, these endogenous processes try to incorporate to the public school new designs, methods and practices from the private sector. The new public management with its control and evaluation systems, controlled autonomy, the publication of results, the choice of school with unique districts, the increase of authority of the director, as well as the cutbacks in the financing of the public centers represent interventions that gradually are producing a damage in the waterline of public schools, understood as compensatory, secular, democratic and comprehensive school.","Markets; New public management; Privatization; Public school; School choice","","","","","19896395","","","","Spanish","Profesorado","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878945421"

As such it has among its functions the ability to detect social requirements that have not been met and to enhance institutional solutions while encouraging social participation. According to Peraldi & Rombaldi (2009) it is essential to integrate social organizations in weakened rural areas. But advances in such processes require that the social utility produced by these organizations is socially recognised. We argue that it is also important that the sector recognises its own network of relationships by identifying the sector strengths and weaknesses. This paper considers the third sector of social action in Teruel, a province of Aragon in Spain. Our research analyses (a) the configuration of different dimensions of social capital, (b) how social capital is expressed through third sector of social action networks and (c) how the sector organises addressing challenges in primarily rural contexts. The research results are expected to enable a diagnosis of the sector in the province of Teruel, contributing to strengthening this sector. Methodology We chose the case study as the basis of the methodological design. Considering Flybjerg (2004) classification, we address Teruel an extreme case study due to its particular features: a combination of a low population rate, a high rate of aging and low capacity for population renewal due to migration trends. In addition the population is geographically dispersed across small communities in 236 municipalities with only two cities of more than 10,000 people. The combination of population and territory present a sparsely-populated province with one of the lowest population density rates in Spain at 941 inhabitants per square kilometer. Teruel is the province with the highest average population age at 45.1 years (Mur, 1998). To this scenario we need to add the government's reduction' in public spending on social services. We argue that third-sector organizations must overcome important challenges to accomplish their social intervention objectives, as the sustainability of social services in these areas of combined depopulation and aging is relevant and urgent. The study relies on a mixed-method approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments. Following Li's (2015) observations on methods and strategies for the study of social capital, the first part of our design' includes a survey with 58 questions to gather information on variables related to the existing capital in the sector: sense of belonging, relationship with institutions, network density, strength of the network links, shared values, resource sharing, and assessment of innovations. The study population was composed of 108 third sector entities with the criterion of our study. The response rate was 48.35%. As part of the mixed-method design suggested by (Ugalde and Balbastre, 2013), personal interviews with seven stakeholders were conducted. The selection of informants was based on multi-reference suitability and included mainly representatives of and experts on the local third sector of social action. In parallel we conducted two focus groups, the first with staff from six local entities and the second with volunteers of five local entities. The data was analysed using SPSS v.19. and UCINETv.6 to generate visualizations of networks, and discourse analysis techniques (Fischer, 2003; Almaguer et al, 2014) were used to analyse narratives in the interviews and discussion groups. Findings In the case of Teruel, although there is a generalized sense of belonging to the sector and territory with 88.6% agreeing that their organization identifies with Teruel's third sector and 70.4% that entities in the province share values and principles, however it holds some distinctions in relation to the social system. For instance, the creation of independent local associations is positively regarded and proudly distinguished from the subsidiaries of larger organizations. Geographical identity creates a strong sense of attachment to the specific towns in which the organizations are located, to the Teruel province, and ultimately to the autonomous region. This strong identification with the local space creates an important characteristic in their collaboration with institutions and organizations. In addition to the intensification of competition to provide goods and services, which affects the effectiveness of intervention of the third sector of social action, the results also suggest the fragmentation of smaller organizations in contrast to the increasing specialization of larger ones. In the focus group, it was explained that this differentiation is produced by the professionalization of larger organizations (having professional employers and volunteers with large trajectory) compared to small organizations that are not consolidated in their human resources capital. In their interviews, institutional actors suggested that the concept of third sector entities is more rooted in large than in small organizations due to the former holding a global perspective of the sector. This may also be the result of their professionalization through their employees and technicians, unlike small organizations that mainly use volunteers for their work and therefore invest less time and fewer resources in creating links and engaging in wider coalitions or networks through which strategic information is distributed. Findings in the relational dimension suggest that characteristics and attributes of principal relationships and their incentives are constructed collectively rather than defined by specific organizations, with 72.7% of respondents believing that both a good and a bad reputation affects entities' relationships in the same sector, the same percentage (72.7%) indicates that the main reason for establishing relationships with other entities is the pursuit of the same interests, rather than geographical proximity (11.4%) or trust (11.4%) as first hypothesized. The survey results reveal that political and religious values are not necessarily shared with other organizations as a common denominator. However, in the network analysis we find complementary evidence of the network relationships. After performing various tests (estimation of the degree of centrality) on the network of 65 organizations (see figure 3), it was found that a set of entities plays an important role through its high level of collaboration with other entities, and that a particular multisectoral organization of religious origin conducts the most brokerage (i.e. the node that concentrates greatest density and flow of collaboration). The mixed-method approach allowed us to explore other elements of the system. The interviews and discussion groups enabled in-depth investigation of the third-sector network's perceptions of its interactions and led us to the conclusion that the best-connected actors in such networks have a competitive advantage over those that are poorly-connected, actor's connection depends not only on their technological skills but also on other relational and symbolic capital. In this sense the networks established between organizations have strong internal cohesion but weak external connection. Our qualitative findings give more elements to explain the reasons for this trend: the latent meaning that actors give to their membership of and action in these networks has to do with promoting the sociability of its members, especially through volunteering. We conclude that there is a collective construction of social capital, that in this case, priories strengthening intrinsic networks within intra-territorial networks, over extrinsic, extraterritorial networks (i.e. across autonomous regions, the country or the continent). Face-to-face interaction, interpersonal trust and relationships play an important role in this construction of intrinsic networks. However new strategies and capitals are needed to reinforce the connection with extraterritorial networks. Network analysis was relevant to understanding how the whole resources flows within the embedded network of social relations (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998), and discourse analysis of the qualitative data allowed us to refine the answers and deepen the substantive features of the relations established between organizations as well as the importance of trust and reciprocity. We have found that the network of third sector entities in the province of Teruel has a centralized structure, with three medium-sized entities acting as reference nodes for the cohesion of the network. Also the structure of the network of relationships between the third and the public sector is considerably denser (based on collaborative agreements and complementary action through concerted funding and grants, etc.) than that in the industrial sector. This correlates with the third sector's financial dependence on government institutions and its relevance as a central point of information to the majority of the actors. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","Networks; Reciprocity; Social capital; Third social action sector; Trust","","I.

In previous public goods experimental research the design of the sequence ordering of decisions have been limited because of the necessity of simplicity taking priority over realism, which means they never accurately reproduce the social structure that constrains the available information. Multi-agent simulation can help us to overcome this limitation. In our model, agents are placed in 230 different networks and each networks' success rates are analyzed. We find that some network attributes -density and global degree centrality and heterogeneity-, some initial parameters of the strategic situation -the provision point- and some agents' attributes -beliefs about the probability that others will cooperate-, all have a significant impact on the success rate. Our paper is the first approach to an explanation for the scalar variant of production of public goods in a network using computational simulation methodology, and it outlines three main findings. (1) A less demanding collective effort level does not entail more success: the effort should neither be as high as to discourage others, nor so low as to be let to others. (2) More informed individuals do not always produce a better social outcome: a certain degree of ignorance about other agents' previous decisions and their probability of cooperating are socially useful as long as it can lead to contributions that would not have occurred otherwise. (3) Dense horizontal groups are more likely to succeed in the production of step-level public goods: social ties provide information about the relevance of each agent's individual contribution. This simulation demonstrates the explanatory power of the structural properties of a social system because agents with the same decision algorithm produce different outcomes depending on the properties of their social network. © JASSS.","Collective Behaviour; Decision Making; Public Goods; Social Networks","","F.

This dependency is shown through the analysis of some of social science's own theories, taking as examples the theoretical work of three disciplines: sociology (Niklas Luhmann), anthropology (Marvin Harris) and history (Fernand Braudel). The demonstration involves expanding the concept of causality and its application in the theories previously mentioned, thus allowing us to concludethat there is an inverse relationship between emergence and causation.

Design thinking registered in social systems (complex by definition) resolution must have a very specific and particular way of approach that, addressing multiple aspects from different disciplines, fields of knowledge and human experience must interpret and translate into requirements for design solutions. This implies a change in the paradigm, this is to say thinking about the design process in an open and complex manner rather than in a linear and reticulate manner, relating conceptual outlines of dichotomies such as theory-practice, reason-emotion among others. This allows design to contemplate multiple variables and relationships in it attending the contingency in a systemic way and reducing fear of uncertainty and implicit chaos in its processes. This article presents a reflection on design methods related to research and the creation of the discipline as a contribution to the definition of specific aspects. The reflection addresses initially theories such as ""design thinking"" and the origins of its research outlines. These outlines derive from the hard sciences and the atomization of knowledge, the impossibility of its direct application to design as part of the social sciences, the complexity as an essential element in the design process and the growing lack of definition while incorporating multiple contradictory variables given its multidisciplinary character.","Chaos; Complexity; Dichotomy; Methodology Of Design; Paradigms Of Design; Process Of Design","","","","Universidad de Caldas","17947111","","","","Spanish","Kepes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991710991"

This article proposes an alternative reading of this theory which implies a reconsideration of the part of the structures of inequality for the reproduction of social systems. The main argument is that the structures of inequality guide the manner with which social systems select individuals for their operations. At the same time, the luhmannian thesis about the superiority of functional differentiation is defended, because while the structures of inequality may vary, assuming contingent strengths whose transformation does not represent the transformations of society, the functional differentiation represents the identity of society, remaining as an invariable and necessary dimension in the horizon of meaning in modern times. © 2014, EDUFBA - Editora Universttaria.

The author of the article attempts to show that its distinction lies in taking the immense diversity of small social interactions as a starting point for the analysis of both face-to-face situations and large-scale institutions and social processes. Here the social field is described as made up of multiple propagations of desires and beliefs that spread from one individual to other, taking countless directions, interfering with each other, forming networks, and escaping them in search of new connections. The author attempts to show, also, that this point of view doesn't deny the existence of social systems but understands them as open ensembles of immanent and partial relationships of collective beliefs and desires. This is why Tarde may be considered the founder of a molecular or micro-physical sociology. © The Author(s) 2013.","Cartographic knowledge; Gabriel Tarde; micro-sociology; polygenesis; social ensembles","","S.

Different from many former approaches in the theories of information and also in biosemiotics in our progressive perspective, we show: on the one hand, that the forms of meaning emerge alongside with information and energy; on the other, that information can be visualised as being always meaningful - in a sense to be clarified, which extends Floridi's General Definition of Information - rather than meaning showing up as a later specification of information within social systems only. In the regressive perspective the category of meaning is explored starting from the manifestation of reality in its own level of interaction. Based upon the physical constraints of the manifestation through electromagnetic waves generated by an object of observation, which constitutes the basis of animal vision, we analyse the limits of the meaning-offer of such manifestation. This allows us: (1) to compare the efficiency of natural evolution in the reception of such meaning-offer; (2) to analyse the conditions for developing a hermeneutical agency able to acknowledge the reality underlying its manifestation. Hence, what we actually do - through this dual perspective - is to follow the strict line of the Unified Theory of Information in the sense of Hofkirchner, visualising information and energy as two different categorical aspects of one and the same underlying primordial structure.","Biosemiotics; Electromagnetic theory; Meaning; Perception; Philosophy of information; Quantum gravity; Unified theory of information","","J.

Led by Bela H. Banathy, they cancelled the sessions and created a conversation methodology that has proven far more effective. Dozens of conversations have now been held around the world. Problem: At a recent conversation in Linz, Austria, a team devoted its inquiry to the Banathy Conversation Methodology (BCM) itself, asking, in particular, how to develop and spread the methodology further, beyond the systems science community. Method: The team captured key features and benefits of BCM and developed new tools. Results: Described herein are the development of the methodology, its theoretical underpinnings, the methodology itself, heuristics for successful conversations, and an example of how the methodology is spreading. Implications: Ultimately, the hope is to develop the methodology in such ways that communities could apply it to meet significant challenges and co-create their futures.","Conversation; Dialogue; Guided evolution; Social systems design","","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","1782348X","","","","English","Constr.

Methodologically, the first refers to the configuration of a selfreferent question that deals with forms of meaning directed to the social system; from this basis, the world can be approached. The second implies reflecting precisely about the conditions of possibility for this issue, its limitations and the way that it generates self-implied descriptions of society.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper looks at the mathematical and logical development of human society structure. Findings: Existence of relations with positive imperative modality (obligation) would constitute the skeleton of the system. Negative imperative modality (prohibition) would be the immunological system of protection of the system. Modality permission the muscular system, that gives the necessary flexibility to the system, in as much to the modality faculty its neurocerebral system, because it allows him to make decisions. Transactions of energy, money, merchandise, population, etc. would be the equivalent one to the sanguineous system. These economic transactions and inferential relations, depend, as well, of the existence of a legislative body with their obligations, prohibitions and permissions that regulate them.

Conceptual Agreement Theory (CAT) models social agreement as a simplified communicational event in which an Observer (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.) and Actor (Formula presented.)         (Formula presented.) exchange ideas about a concept (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.), and where (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)uses that information to infer whether (Formula presented.)         (Formula presented.)’s conceptual state is the same as its own (i.e., to infer agreement). Agreement may be true (when (Formula presented.)    (Formula presented.) infers that(Formula presented.)         (Formula presented.) is thinking (Formula presented.)         (Formula presented.) and this is in fact the case, event (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)) or illusory (when (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)infers that(Formula presented.)(Formula presented.) is thinking (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)and this is not the case, event (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.)). In CAT, concepts that afford (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.) or (Formula presented.)         (Formula presented.) become more salient in the minds of members of social groups. Results from an agent-based model (ABM) and probabilistic model that implement CAT show that, as our conceptual analyses suggested would be the case, the simulated social system selects concepts according to their usefulness to agents in promoting agreement among them (Experiment 1). Furthermore, the ABM exhibits more complex dynamics where similar minded agents cluster and are able to retain useful concepts even when a different group of agents discards them (Experiment 2). We discuss the relevance of CAT and the current findings for analyzing different social communication events, and suggest ways in which CAT could be put to empirical test. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agent-based modeling; Conceptual Agreement Theory; Conceptual diversity; Dynamics of conceptual development","","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","00335177","","","","English","Qual.

This work develops the grounds of both viewpoints. For the former, whose theoretical axis is the notion of subjectivity, contributions of E. Goffman are reintroduced, and, for the latter, whose theoretical axis is the notion of system/environment, N. Luhmann's proposal are taken into account. Once the validity of both perspectives has been theoretically sketched, an analysis of a single case has been made: the speech delivered on March 21st 2012 by Iván Fuentes, the leader of Movimiento Social por la Región de Aysén.

Thus, the inequalities embedded in socio-environmental problems may also be seen as problems of inclusion: inclusion in the space of decisions, inclusion in the space of those affected by those decisions, inclusion in the space of those receiving compensations for them. This connection is made manifest by the multiplication of movements aimed at making these inequalities visible and including the affected in the political debate. However, by being duplicated, the distinction is also made more complex: inclusion/exclusion and equality/inequality are two observation schemes orthogonal to each other, so that crossing them multiplies the possible results. From this perspective, based on developments of the Theory of Social Systems, and the French school of New Inequalities, the paper will look at the current trends towards participation within Chilean energy policy, and particularly to the Estándares de Participación (Standards of Participation) built into the governmental program Energía 2050. Specifically, it will offer a reflection on the expectations to equality and inclusion these programs try to respond to, and on the limits that these same expectations imply.","Energía 2050; Inclusion; Inequality; Participative politics; Socio-environmental conflicts","","M.

The traditional green approach, founded on a moral view of the socio-natural relationship and inclined to a radical transformation of the current social system, now seems misguided. In this regard, sustainability should be considered as an inherently open principle for guiding social action that also serves as a framework for discussing the kind of society we wish to have. The distinction between an open and a closed account of sustainability aims to reflect this. But, at the same time, sustainability should go beyond the common distinctions between strong and weak versions of the principle, turning substitutability into a much more flexible criterion that puts cultivated (rather than natural and human-made) capital at its centre. Sustainability is thus to be freed from nature. Adopting a post-natural stance with regard to sustainability is a key part of the much-needed renewal of environmentalism itself. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis.","climate change; democracy; environmentalism; nature; substitutability; Sustainability","climate change; democracy; environmentalism; sustainability","M.

Structuralist theories offer deterministic and crippling explanations, and current analysis of the phenomenon tend to turn social conflicts into psychological problems. Therefore, bringing educational research into school experience help us to see how the context affects the disadvantaged children, and how they respond to educational and social system in a negotiation process clearly unbalanced. This is the main value of the present document. It is an abstract of a biographical research that inquires into the life of Medina, an adolescent who comes from a marginal context and narrates his experiences in and outside the school from the juvenile detention centre where he is locked. It offers a wide vision of the social route that he has crossed throughout his life. The research shows a class differentiation that divides the society in two: you, the good ones; and we, the bad ones. The school failure, fruit of this division, leaves place to the social failure, provoking ‘guerrillas against the good ones’ of boys who have learned to devalue itself like people and group. But to accept their status as ‘bad’ serves to assert themselves and fight against those who seek to devote ourselves to what they do not want to be and a position they do not want to occupy. They become ‘warriors’ who struggle against a social system that marginalizes them, even if it means taking them to their own destruction. © 2015, Ministry Education and Science.

By elaborating on different general sociological theories (particularly systems theory and relational sociology) and empirical research on the topic, this article argues that clientelistic networks in Latin America emerge in an operative context of modernization crisis that strongly disturbs the personal modus vivendi. This crisis produces a symbolic framework of deflating value commitments clientelistic networks can deal with only with limited relational effects, that, additionally, negatively impact on the generalization of social trust.","Clientelistic networks; Modernization crisis; Modus vivendi; Social relations; Social systems; Trust; Value commitments","","","","Universidad de Chile","07180527","","","","Spanish","Rev.

Due to this adoption, there have been several discussions regarding the applicability of this concept beyond its biological origins. Problem: This article addresses the conception of Luhman's autopoietic social systems, and confronts this vision with criticism both of the original authors of the concept of autopoiesis and of other social theorists in order to elucidate the main problems of this debate and its possible solutions. Method: The objectives of the article are reached by means of a theoretical reconstruction of the main issues of the debate on the concept of autopoiesis. The main method used for the research is the use of documentary sources to discuss the arguments. Results: We claim that it is justified to extend the concept of autopoiesis from its biological origin to other disciplines, and to develop its interdisciplinary character, following the spirit of systems theory and constructivism. Implications: Our results are useful for promoting the development of new interdisciplinary research in the field of systems theory and constructivism. Important changes to practice should be made, namely, the development of new research methods, new concepts and perspectives. Constructivist content: The concept of autopoiesis is one of the fundamental concepts of the constructivist epistemology. The discussion proposes a radical understanding of this concept in order to realize all its explanatory potential.","Biological autopoiesis; Niklas Luhmann; Social autopoiesis; Systems theory","","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","1782348X","","","","English","Constr.

The authors combined a retrospective and prospective analysis, an interdisciplinary approach, collaboration among climatologists, geographers, and sociologists, and the participation of local farmers and stakeholders, all contributing their own knowledge. This paper assesses the adaptability of olive-growing systems to climate irregularities over the past 50 yr. First, a climatic study shows that rainfall decreased by 18% during the period 1955-2009. Water resource availability has declined 2 or 3 times more than rainfall, in part because of the expansion of irrigation, which ameliorated the effects of droughts and increased profitability. Second, relationships between rainfall and both irrigated and rainfed olive yields are assessed. These show that the cumulative rainfall of the 2 yr preceding the crop explains 41% of the variability of irrigated olive tree yields and 46% of rainfed yields; this result was unexpected for irrigated yields. Third, this study examines the perceptions of climate variability of 15 farmers, the views of 16 local stakeholders [developers, olive oil professionals, local authorities, a conservationist, and a representative of a local nongovernmental organization (NGO)]. The perceptions of the farmers are interpreted with respect to their socioeconomic status. All farmer and stakeholder interviewees know to a certain extent the climatic influence on olive yields, and most of them acknowledge the recent climatic changes. These findings will be valuable for future assessments of the adaptability of the agricultural and social systems to climate change. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.","","","M. Cohen; Univ.

Their most striking difference lies in their social system: black-and-white colobus live in small groups with mainly male-mediated dispersal but where females can also disperse, whereas red colobus live in larger groups with males described as philopatric. To investigate whether genetic evidence supports the reported patterns of dispersal based on observational data, we examined eight black-and-white and six red colobus social groups from Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau. Microsatellite markers revealed a lack of sex-biased dispersal for black-and-white colobus. Gene flow, mainly mediated by females, better explained the genetic patterns found in red colobus, with some evidence for less extensive male dispersal. In contrast to the microsatellite data, low mitochondrial diversity for the black-and-white colobus suggests that historical and/or long-range male-mediated gene flow might have been favored. In red colobus, the co-existence of three divergent mitochondrial haplogroups suggests that the Cantanhez population contains a secondary contact zone between divergent lineages that evolved in allopatry. Female-biased dispersal in this species may be a major factor contributing to the colonization by such differentiated mitochondrial lineages in the region. Overall, we find evidence for a spatio-temporal change in the dispersal patterns of the colobus monkeys of Cantanhez, with mitochondrial DNA indicating dispersal by mainly a single sex and microsatellite data suggesting that recently both sexes appear to be dispersing within the population.

In archaeological terms the existence of certain attributes of the artifacts that co-varies in time and space imply some kind of relationship between persons who produced and used them.

People who are seeking education and training try to take advantage of maximum benefit of their formation. In this context the aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence of the effects of continuous training on Employment Stability in the Spanish labor market. The dependent variable includes two situations of the active workers: continuous and discontinuous employability. To distinguish between them an Employability Index Stability was calculated taking into account two factors: employed time and job security. The data obtained from a survey of a nationwide sample of 918 employed individuals has been analysed through a binary logit model. The coefficients estimated have revealed a positive and significant relationship between the probability of employment stability and continuous vocational training received. The results obtained in this study showed that the whole process of education of people influences the career choices and work-life. So it is important to redefine the role of educators and trainers, and adapt new teaching-learning methods to promote awareness and capacity building and skills that enable workers to enter and stay in a new working environment conditioned by important changes in techniques of education and economic and social systems. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.","Binary logit model; Continuous training; Employment stability; Spanish labor market","Commerce; Job satisfaction; Mathematical models; Personnel training; Stability; Binary logit model; Capacity building; Continuous process; Dependent variables; Education and training; Index stabilities; Information society; Job security; Labor markets; Single decision; Social systems; Teaching-learning method; Vocational training; Whole process; Working environment; Employment","X.

This research integrates cultural and natural factors to explore how the Chinchorro carried on with their way of life isolated at geographically restricted perennial river mouths with fresh water along the Atacama Desert in the Pacific coast of South America. Within these rather crowded settlings, they created and maintained a social system catalyzed by a complex funerary tradition, embodied by a unique funerary ideological discourse that resulted in the creation of a sacred landscape or ""spiritscape"". We argue that the extreme hyperaridity of the coastal Atacama Desert (21° - 17.30° S), and the extraordinary biomass production of the marine littoral constituted a fundamental milieu for the maintenance of their long-term social system. The Chinchorro belief system lasted for several millennia (8,000-4,000 BP), but new ways of life and burial practices followed major changes in the coastal ecosystem they relied on, which would have influenced how the ""old tradition"" was manifested over time. Conversely, we sustain that these natural ""constraints"" faced by the Chinchorro along the coast of the Atacama Desert, were influential, in the course of their history or the way they socially organized themselves.","Chinchorro spiritscape; Coastal Atacama Desert; Hyperaridity; Sacred landscape","","C.M.

Presenting data from a case study of two European rural areas of different levels of economic development, the text argues that entrepreneurial research needs to incorporate qualitative data on the sociocultural preconditions of emerging innovative institutions.

An art museum in Chile was analyzed, based on in-depth interviews with individuals located in different positions in the organization. Confirming previous studies by Paul J. DiMaggio, the article observes that an art museum in Chile has generated internal organizational coalitions, each of which gives meaning to the museum's visitors in a different manner. Applying the theory of social systems, these coalitions are explained by reference to three aspects of a social system of art: a) how it generates a memory of its own, b) how it defines rules for participation, and c) how it is affected by problems of social exclusion that are characteristic of a functionally differentiated society. These coalitions differ from each other with regard to the ""patterns of causal attribution"" that their members assume when explaining the number of visitors that the museum receives.","Access; Museums; Social exclusion; Social inclusion; Social systems theory; Sociology of the arts","","C.

Next, strategies and technologies required to implement and measure education are presented. From a holistic viewpoint, 'sustainable social building' factors must be evaluated, in part, using an educational indicator, to cover all aspects of sustainable building. It is contended that those responsible for building (local authorities, constructors and users) must be informed of and trained in sustainable issues.

SocLab is a platform for the modelling, simulation and analysis of cooperation relationships within social organizations – and more generally Systems of Organized Action. Design/methodology/approach – Simulation results, including an interesting tendency for a Free Rider model, will be given. Considering that actors’ decision-making processes are not just driven by instrumental interest, the SocLab learning simulation algorithm has been extended to represent moral sensitivity, making actors trying to prevent bad emotions and feel good ones. Findings – Some simulation results about actors’ collaboration and emotions in a Free Rider model were presented. A noteworthy tendency is that actors’ unconditional collaboration, which occurs when their moral sensitivity reaches its highest value, is not so good since it exempts other actors from collaboration (they take advantage from the unconditional collaboration), while values of moral sensitivity somewhat below the highest value (between 0.7 and 0.9) still induces collaboration from others. Originality/value – The research and results presented in this paper have not been presented in other papers or workshops. The presented quantitative definition of emotions (determining indexes of emotions) is different to previous approaches – for instance, to Ortony, Clore and Collins (OCC) qualitative descriptions and to logical descriptions. Similarly, simulation of morality in organizations is a new research field, which has received scarce attention up to now. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Game theory; Modelling; Organizational structures; Simulation; Social systems","","O.

Most studies in the field are based on critical perspective, particularly in Habermas’s theory of communicative action. It is our goal to indicate a new avenue for theoretical analysis of Social Management, based on Structuration Theory, proposed by British sociologist Anthony Giddens. Having among its main assumptions the duality of structure (the structure is, at the same time, the means and the result of the action) and the recognition of human action as intentional, reflexive and cognitive, it is understood that the structurationist perspective provides consistent support for the understanding of Social Management practices, especially with regard to the process of structuraction of deliberative system and conformation of the public sphere, the theoretical bases that support Social Management. In order to enable this new approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that incorporates Mansbridge’s (1999) deliberative system in Whittington’s (1992) structurationist multidimensional model of social systems. Within this framework, and similar to what has been established by Whittington (1992) for the other social systems, basic rules and resources (the structural properties in Giddens’ perspective) for the deliberative system have been defined – argumentative deliberation and dialogic participation, respectively. The framework also suggests that these properties are both means and outcomes of social management practices (understood as dialogic managerial action), configuring the central idea of the Structuration Theory: the concept of duality of structure. With his framework, Whittington (1992) believes that he is “putting Giddens into action”, contributing to the use of the Structuration Theory in empirical research, and not restricting it to ontological discussions of a broader scope. With the addition of a deliberative system to this model, we expect to be contributing to the consolidation of Social Management, establishing a fruitful theoretical interface with the Structuration Theory. © 2013 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

Therefore, it emphasizes the trust model that social systems, such as the expert system, establish in life today, which are capable of producing a peculiar subordination to scientific and technical knowledge, while simultaneously providing no information about their operating principles. The second aspect of the article aims to highlight the importance of the moral responsibility of the experimental subjects, proposing, on the basis of Hanna Arendt's reflections, a shift of the central axis of the experimental analysis from the obedience category to the consent category. © 2014, Universidade de Brasilia.

Tamayo (CentroGeo), México, Mexico","During the past five years, CentroGeo has developed several cybercartographic atlases. This chapter explores the circular relationships of these prototypes with the social systems they interact with. This exploration is guided by the conceptual framework of second order cybernetics that has the potential to approach communication processes in social contexts, as well as to explain more specifically issues related to language, cognition, and meaning; issues of utter importance when exploring the interaction between cybercartography and society. The cybercartographic atlases of CentroGeo play a major role as empirical Cybercartographic prototypes. This is a field where cartography and cybernetics converge generating messages in a complex language, which is able to transmit the spatial dimension in a holistic and effective way. The execution of the cybernetic character of these cybercartographic atlases demands active participation of their users and involvement in social interaction processes. Second order cybernetic concepts are used to explain the circular relationships between research groups, relevant stakeholders, and geographic space, during the design and development stages of the atlases; as well as, the feedback loops and second order cycles present in the interactions between users and technological prototypes. Users and stakeholders act as observers of the geographic space and observe themselves as participant actors in that space. Also, in group communication processes, these atlases may play a relevant role in the construction of a spatial language and in the triggering of processes of decision making and planning of joint actions to improve situations prevalent in the geographic space. Cybercartographic atlases are described as social products, fed by society in their development, and once embodied in technological prototypes, as entities that may impact the social context in which they are inserted. Three possible cybercartographic atlas roles are explored: their role in the construction of a spatial language among the users; their role in the user's new perceptions of the geographic space including the awareness of his/her role in shaping such space; and their role in social steering processes. Some issues are advanced for further research in the field, such as the role of cybercartographic atlases in cognitive processes involving the spatial dimension, in the construction of social knowledge about the geographical space, in the use of this knowledge in collective action, and in the building of self-steering capacities among the intervening social groups and organizations. Also, work remains to respond to the user's needs, demands, and purposes; to facilitate the effective social insertion of the prototypes and to include the cultural dimension in the design process. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Acknowledgement of this fact has important epistemological implications, since, contrary to some theoretical formulations e.g., the 'society without men' of N. Luhmann), only by regarding human beings as the crucial element of any type of society is it possible to perceive their needs and therefore the values supposedly intended to satisfy them. The 'need/value' binomial thereby becomes the essential prime material of sociological analysis. Both NEEDS as a factor of motivation and VALUES as a factor of satisfaction can be operationalized and quantified to depict the principal achievements of complex social organizations, their deviation from predetermined standards and the extent to which they ultimately adapt to the environment. Standardized and therefore comparable axiological profiles comprise a tool that can be generally applied to establish a preliminary measure of the degree of overall organizational efficiency. The concept of organization is taken here in its broader sense and is applicable to any type of society organized so as to achieve certain goals.

According to Luhmann, evolutionary theory - both biological and social - gets started trying to resolve the paradox of the probability of the improbable. However, Luhmann does not specifically clarify what the paradox involves, what are the ways to solve it, and how the evolution can explain the facts adduced in it. In this article, these flaws are faced up through the systematization of the probabilistic elements that characterize the evolutionary process, taking elements from evolutionary biology and the probability theory. From the four ways of probabilization here described, Luhmann seems to refer indirectly only to three of them. This probabilistic systematization not only allows dealing with the complex social order problem, but also anticipates future investigations of social evolution.","Complexity; Evolution; Niklas Luhmann; Probability of the improbable; Social order","","P.

We will discuss the archaeobotanical data and the results of stable isotope analyses of a set of human samples spreading from the initial ceramic (300 B.C.-A.D. 200) up to the Inca contact moments (A.D. 1450-1550) in order to study the introduction and adoption of maize in this region. Stable carbon isotopes can be used to determine the presence and estimate the abundance of C4 plants such as Zea mays, in past diets. The results show that i) the adoption of this plant in the region was later than A.D. 200, ii) it became a regular dietary resource for Llolleo groups, iii) its use was more important for the Aconcagua groups with a differential gender consumption and, finally iv) that Zea mays dietary importance diminished during Inca times. During the Early Ceramic period maize horticulturalists were contemporaneous and shared the landscape with hunter-gatherers and quinoa horticulturalists; therefore the dietary habits were peculiar to specific groups. This evidence provides new insights into social systems but also left unanswered questions, especially concerning the earliest moments of maize development in this region.

Prisons, their norms, procedures and values adhere to the absolute primacy of domination and control of the incarcerated mass. It follows that the maintenance of internal order and discipline are transfigured into the penal organization 's primary purpose. The programs and activities regarded as ""re-educative""fit into this working logic, guiding their actions and objectives by the need to subjugate the punished persons, adjusting them to the social system of prison. The inmate's resistance to control is, however, patent. Education does not, by any means, remain neutral in this process (struggle) of subjugation and resistance. Its methodological assumptions and its daily practices can contribute to establish school as the succeeding resource in the preservation and development of persons, in the interstices of the domination process. The article tries to outline some possibilities of education so that the prerogatives of penal management do not shatter educative practices, prescribing its actions. In doing that, it seeks to indicate an alternative so that incarcerated persons, even under the hostile conditions they face, have the later opportunity to produce culture and knowledge, showing paths to a human development that allows them to designate the world present and future, in a continuous act of creation and re-creation, signification and re-signification.","Adult education; Penal system; Rehabilitation","","","","Faculdade de Educacao da Universidade de Sao Paulo","15179702","","","","Portuguese","Educ.

The encased study stemmed from research completed at the University of Manchester. The study aimed to gain perspectives and make sense of social skills development (communication, networking and collaboration skills) in the particular setting of knowledge facilitation within virtual environments in three universities of the Manchester city region. Findings - The personal lifelong learning journey that educational and academic staff undertake in order to become skilled knowledge facilitators online is perceived and represented as a full learning cycle of multiple dimensions.

The ""human factor"" is often vaguely identified as a risk factor in hazardous socio-technical systems, particularly when accidents occur. But it is usually viewed more or less as a ""black box"", under-specified and under-analyzed. Three key aims of the article are: (1) to identify and theorize in a systematic way the multi-dimensional character of the ""human factor"" in risky systems and accidents; (2) to enable the systematic application of a substantial social science knowledge to the regulation of hazardous systems, their managers and operatives as well as regulators, especially relating to the ""human factor;"" (3) to serve as an guiding tool for researchers and regulators in the collection and organization of data on human and other factors in risky systems and accidents.

It starts from a paradigmatic change that took place in the field of Science in general after the rupture of the Newtonian model. In the 20th century, the paradigm of order, symmetry, regularity, and regulation of the intellect over things enters a crisis. After new formulation in Physics, Chemistry, etc, a new universe emerges over the bases radically opposed to those of modern Science. There is rehabilitation of chaos, process irreversibility, indeterminism, the observer, and complexity. That new conceptual environment served as the substrate for Niklas Luhmann's theoretical reflection. Through the Theory of the Social systems, the author proposes the reduction of the world's complexity. The role of social systems is to reduce complexity by its difference regarding the surroundings. By reducing complexity, on the other hand, he also builds his own complexity. Luhmann sees complexity when it is no longer possible that each element relates in any moment to all others. Complexity forces selection, which means contingency and risk. Luhmann further discusses the concept of complexity by introducing the figure of the observer and the distinction of complexity as the unity of a multiplicity. He also deals with the limit of relationship connections, the time factor, self-reference of the operations, and representation of complexity as meaning. Finally, the article deals with complexity in the system of science, the way it reduced internal and external complexity according to its own operative basis. © 2006 Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sociologia - UFRGS.","Autopoiesis; Complex world; Complexity; Interdisciplinarity; Multidisciplinarity; Science; Second-order observation; Social systems; System and surroundings; Trans-disciplinarity","","","","Instituto de Filosofia e Ciencias Humanas-UFRGS","15174522","","","","Portuguese","Sociologias","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33748119322"

It emphasizes the challenges associated with teaching this kind of research in Mexico and illustrates ways we address those challenges. It also illustrates that a high level of personal growth often accompanies AR training and that such growth, as well as learning the ‘mechanics' of AR, is significantly enhanced when faculty become deeply engaged with students during the entire learning experience. The article contributes to what is known about teaching action research in graduate university settings, specifically, about how to teach it, reasons for teaching it, and unintended consequences of teaching it. It describes problems in teaching and mastering AR competence and uses experiences in Latin America's oldest masters program in organization development to illustrate solutions. Examples from student projects demonstrate how action research coursework translates to increased student skills and simultaneously to increased effectiveness of the social systems in which the students conduct research. Finally, the article describes work that led a university to include action research training in all of its graduate programs. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

The main argument presented has to do with the link between social professions and the permanent challenge faced by welfare states and democracies to provide answers to social problems and needs. Hence, social education is characterized as a means to fight social exclusion and grant wider access to social rights. Through educational programmes, projects and activities, social educators can struggle against exclusion and social injustice. Therefore, the authors sustain that exclusion is the hinge that articulates the connection between social practitioners and citizens' trust. Specific attention is paid to the capacity of Spanish social educators to be a depository of trust from their clients. The idea that excluded people actually have no choice but to trust someone else, such as for instance, social educators, is explored. According to this analysis, unless an effort is made in Spain to explain to lay citizens the role of social educators the development of trust will be more difficult. Therefore, a major challenge for Spanish social educators at the moment is to expand the knowledge and awareness about their practices in order to promote among citizens not only general confidence in the social system but trust in these social professionals. © International Sociological Association.","Social education; Social exclusion; Social professions; Spain; Trust; Welfare state","","J.

(ITESM), Monterrey, NL 64849, Mexico","This article presents the systems sciences as a field of inquiry and discusses the way in which it has evolved in relation to the humanities. Following a brief historical overview and assessment of the systems sciences by considering their origins and foundations in general system thinking, the review highlights the key players and the major trends in the field, and leads to a consideration of the ways in which it complements and contrasts the methods of human-related studies generally pursued in the humanities. It discusses the potential for the systems sciences to enrich descriptive, instructional, and explanatory orientations of contemporary Geisteswissenschaften through the inclusion of normative considerations. The normative component of the systems sciences is considered within an evolutionary framework that presents holism as a methodology for understanding the dynamics of complex 'real-world' (ontological) systems and suggests action imperatives for their viable and sustainable design over time. Through the tools metaphor, modeling and simulation, interactive design and other praxes, systems scientists investigate the goals and ends of systems and their interactions within environments shared with, and provided for, one another. In this way social systems in general, and human activity systems in particular, can be described as a function of their degree of purposefulness in terms of the role of human values in concrete circumstances. Through the tools of systems analysis and design, systems science represents the world of symbols, values, social entities, and cultures as embedded in an embracing order of hierarchies that bridges the gap between C. P. Snow's 'Two Cultures' of the sciences and the humanities. The use of modeling in systems sciences provides the language of design and the means by which creativity is applied in the course of inventing, making, assessing, and implementing the designs. In this way it lends to the humanities the capability to deal with increasing systemic complexities, rapid societal changes, and design decisions that affect the sustainable evolution of human societies within the wider context of their life support systems.","Design; Human values; Humanities; Societal evolution; Systems science","","","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","10927026","","","","English","Syst.

This discussion is based on second-order cybernetics principles, in which the researcher's role is considered in the observation process. It emphasizes the idea that media art is a social and aesthetic system based on conversation and autopoietic processes. Design/methodology/approach: This argument is based upon a master's research dissertation on contemporary media art production, conducted at the Center for Interactive Living Studies (Nomads.usp). The methodology is based on an immersion in an action-centered research process: the authors conducted a literature review, interviewed 26 people, including artists, curators and theoreticians, visited several exhibitions, media art centers, and produced an interactive installation. Findings: Aesthetic propositions may trigger conversational processes within different perspectives. The authors see this as related to Luhmann's writings about art as both an aesthetic and social system. Despite the utopian nature of the proposition the authors identify a second-order cybernetic relevance in their investigation. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are related to the intrinsic specificity of the adopted methodology. It may be possible to derive general theoretical abstractions or methods from the described investigation, but this was never the authors' intention. Social implications: The authors suggest recognition of media art as a collective practice, discussing this complex activity at micro (individual goals) and macro (overall goals) levels. Originality/value: This application of self-reference to our reflective art and design research practice will enhance the design of future projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Aesthetic system; Autopoiesis; Conversation; Media art; Second order cybernetics; Social processes; Social system","Cybernetics; Aesthetic system; Auto-poiesis; Conversation; Media arts; Second orders; Social process; Social systems; Exhibitions","A.

This field is linked to public policies/actions, when recognizing critical alternatives to the linear model of technological innovation (to replace it with the situated and distributed, systemic-holistic, and socio-technological interpretation), stressing the particular conditions of production and use of knowledge for the region, with the articulation of ICT, mainly to renovate and incorporate virtual higher-level educational proposals. So, this article contributes to the deepening not only of the 'new sociology of science and technology', but also to different lines of inquiry which affect the programmes of electronic distance education today, characterized by a consumerist scientific- technological boom within global controversy. The practice of a substantive reflexivity will result in not only a new meaning of the concept of social inclusion for a new conviviality within global social systems traversed by ICT, but also in the analysis of proposals that will overcome the socio-educational exclusion mediated by technology, for a social inclusion and a new conviviality. The configuration of this considers the empowerment and practice of digital skills to function with relevance and prudence, in a proactive and responsible way, in a progressive (cyber)-citizenry, with valuable, productive, and valid behaviour to meet equitable needs of life by an intercultural respect, recognition of contradictions and social tensions, theoretical and methodological negotiation, and practice in the hybrid production of alternative frameworks to overcome diverse e-exclusions.","","","B.

We argue that both the logic of the transfer system in India and the system through which people are named for high level positions in Brazil maintain legitimacy insofar as they allow ideas linked to administrative efficiency and combating corruption to be used in justifying decisions that are often motivated by political, economic and electoral interests. We also argue that analyses of the relationship between politics and public administration in both countries should not only take the design of political and electoral institutions and the postulate of electoral rationality into account but also the values that were developed throughout the process in which political institutions and public bureaucracies were constituted.","Brazil; High level positions; Indian; Nominations; Patronage; Political system; Public administration","","F.G.

The founders of structuralism conceived a systemic, multidimensional and dynamic approach. They applied it to the study of improvements in, and the social distribution of, labour productivity generated in the central economies and the effects of these on the societies of the periphery. This outlook challenges the notion of markets as self-regulating systems that return to stable equilibrium positions, presenting them rather as a quantitative expression of the national or international power status of contracting parties. Different development styles and processes progressively alter the power structure of social systems and these changes are reflected in the dynamic of relative market prices.","Economic aspects; Economic dependence; Economic development; Economic policy; Economic systems; Inflation; Latin America; Markets; Neoliberalism; Political aspects; Prices; Structural adjustment; Value","","A. di Filippo; Institute of International Studies, University of Chile, Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Chile; email: armando.difilippo@gmail.com","","United Nations Publications","02512920","","","","English","Cepal Rev.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959867957"

However, as it happens with governments, corporations have understood long ago the challenges of being accepted abroad. In this paper the authors suggest that 'corporate diplomacy' is also a process by which corporations intend to be recognized as representatives of something that might be a concept or a country or its related values. In this case, it is essential to create a sincere adaptation of the corporate values to the societal values if a corporation wishes to have a symbiotic relationship with key stakeholders. 'Corporate diplomacy' thus becomes a complex process of commitment towards society, and in particular with its public institutions, whose main added value to the corporation is a greater degree of legitimacy or ""license-to-operate,"" which in turn improves its power within a given social system. By proposing a certain notion of 'corporate diplomacy' the authors intend to evocate an important role that modern corporations are increasingly playing through their public relations practice and which might be shaping the definition of corporations as institutions within society. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Corporate diplomacy; Legitimacy; Public agenda; Public diplomacy; Public interest; Public relations; Social responsibility","","E.

It is our understanding that regional and innovation policies should be based on a complex systems approach whose emergence is acknowledged in the first part of the paper. Accepting the useless of this meta-theory for research on firms' behaviour and innovation, we develop a preliminary analysis of the strategic behaviour of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Norte region in responding to direct financial support from Structural Funds. The empirical results confirm the research hypothesis that current policies based on financial incentives have little effectiveness in promoting the changes required by SMEs in the globalizing knowledge-based economy. Considering knowledge as an emergent property of complex social systems, as are firms and regions, the paper argues that SMEs need a customized and interactive innovation policy, managed at a regional level.

The argument is based principally on observation of the problems of reproduction of the legal system in 'peripheral countries'. The central thesis of the article is that, in the countries of 'peripheral modernity' the reproduction of the legal system is blocked by a wide variety of social factors, in such a way that one can speak more of the allopoiesis than the autopoiesis of law. Beginning with a biological concept, the article considers the sociological concept of autopoiesis, and then analyzes the concept of autopoiesis of law. Based on this theoretical parameter, the argument about the allopoiesis of law in the 'peripheral countries' is presented. Finally, the article returns to the central theme of the allopoiesis of law in 'peripheral countries' and points to the indications of a normative concept of autopoiesis of law in the theories of Niklas Luhmann and Günther Teubner.","","","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","0263323X","","","","English","J.

In the social doctrine of the Church, the category of ""integral development"" not only contains an explicit normative connotation, but also reflects an implicit social theory to the extent that it presupposes a line of continuity between the individual and society. Such a supposition of continuity is contested by one of the most influential of contemporary social theories, that of Niklas Luhmann. The theory of self-referring social systems is based on a true interpellation, if not refutation, of the well-intentioned desires of every normative theory of development (among them, the social doctrine of the Church). From this point the-author, rather than attempting an exegesis of the concept in the formulations of the Church's magisterium, investigates its present condition in the context of contemporary social transformations.","","","","","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","00493449","","","","Spanish","Teol.

Social memory, with its ideal features but also its material embodiments, must have the collective dimension brought out, without detriment to the shifting and personalized ways with which individuals deal with it. It provides the patterns for the structuring of social life in the hermeneutic-cognitive and in the material, as well as in the space-time dimension. Social creativity is responsible for the introduction of innovations in daily life and in history. Creativity is to a great extent rooted in the fluid unconscious of individuals, but demands rational thinking to achieve greater impact upon social life. Immersed in undetermined social interactions, individual action is mediated by variably (de)centred collective subjectivities that possess a specific property, namely collective causality. Social creativity thus develops in both the individual and the collective dimensions.","Individual/collective; Social creativity; Social memory; Subjectivity","","J.M.

Focussing on street trading in Brazilian cities, the article describes the degree to which street traders are seen as insecure elements within contemporary discourses on urban development. This is followed by a discussion of the arrangements that have been introduced to minimise the perceived insecurity. The arrangements introduced use spatial strategies to displace street traders and contain them in fixed spaces. Yet the spatiality of these strategies is inconsistent with the intrinsically idiosyncratic spatiality of the street traders, which is a spatiality of flow and movement. While official policies deem the metric and non-metric flows and movements of street trading as threats to urban security, these same flows and movements are central to the social and economic security of the individual street trader. In order to describe the different spatialities of street trading more accurately, use is made here of the concept of bubble space (Costa 1989, «espaijos de bolha») to refer to the metric spatiality of street trading and fluid space (Mol & Law 1994) to refer to its non-metric spatiality. It is concluded that processes of social ordering should be sensitive to the particular spatialities that have evolved in corresponding social systems. © Author(s) 2010.

Box 3048, Spain","In this article, relevant mechanisms that have conditioned the diffusion/adoption process of organic farming (OF) in the main organic olive-growing zones of Andalusia, the world's leading olive-producing region located in the south of Spain, have been analyzed mainly within the framework of the Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory. Results point out that the current diffusion model has been exhausted and, therefore, should be revised, if this form of sustainable agriculture is to spread any further. After the first stage of official promotion of organic techniques in a concrete zone of Andalusia, an important intra-regional ""contagion"" among farmers has been detected, whereas external to the agricultural systems influences- administration, scientists, extensionists, and so on-seem not be very important up to the present time. The more determined involvement of these agents in the development and promotion of OF would supplement and reinforce the underlying mechanisms of diffusion and would probably strengthen the spreading of OF in the near future. When new policies are being drawn up in this sector, it is crucial to bear in mind that the process of diffusion/adoption of OF in the olive groves of Andalusia has many characteristics in common with other innovations but also many peculiarities. Moreover, the moment of adoption of OF, in general, is fundamentally related to the region the farms and farmers belong to and to a lesser degree to the characteristics of the farmers and farms. In this sense, early adopters have similar socioeconomic characteristics to late adopters. However, some differences between early and late adopters have been detected: the first ones have less risk aversion, have more contact with informal sources of information, have a more favorable opinion about organic agriculture and, curiously enough, are more dependent and with less experience on agriculture. One important peculiarity of OF is related to its environmental nature: especially for early adopters, the possible economic advantages and risks of OF are not as important for them as other ""externalities"" associated with OF, such as respecting the environment and obtaining healthy products. Another specificity is the special characteristics of the olive-growing social systems: organic agriculture has spread most up to now in the most marginal and underprivileged zones, with older individuals as potential adopters who have limited contact with traditional sources of information, are fairly uncosmopolitan and have little education, are more motivated by environmental than economic reasons, and comparedwith the farmers of the other zones aremore guided by their own practical experience and contact with informal information networks. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Building sustainability involves various relations between built, natural and social systems and therefore comprises a complex of different priorities that require consideration at each stage of a building's life-cycle. To cope with this complexity and to support sustainability systematic, holistic and practical approaches to building design need to be developed. The main objective of a systematic methodology is to support the development of a building design that achieves the most appropriate balance between the different sustainability dimensions, and is, at the same time, practical, transparent and flexible enough to be easily adapted to different types of buildings and technology.It is the aim of this paper to present an innovative approach for developing building sustainability assessment and rating, and to contribute to the evolution of generic methodology and international understanding by introducing an approach which takes the different dimensions of sustainability into account.

Drawing mainly on Niklas Luhmann's theory of self-referentiality, I propose a reinterpretation of relatedness as a property of meaning. That property is defined as a duality of meaning - ie meaning as an event in our experience, yet in itself an experience of reference to acts, places, and other meanings. It implies that the very definition of meaning is referential - it is never self-contained or centred; it, rather, alludes always already to other meanings, acts, and spaces, referentially crossing boundaries while reasserting sensual and perceptive qualities. This renewed concept of meaning is proposed as a way to unveil relationality while actively keeping the subject's experience of identities and different materialities at work in the relation between practice and space. The paper places this key ontological problem and the quest for a relation between the social and the material into a particular, overlooked aspect of the society - space relation: the moment of sociation of practice and its informational, linguistic, and material conditions - a turn to communication and a 'referential approach' to the materiality of the social world.","","conceptual framework; public space; theoretical study","V.

Scenes grow more important in less industrial, more expressively-oriented and contingent societies where traditional constraints fall and self-motivated action around consumption, leisure and amenities is a more important feature of social cohesiveness and interaction. Scenes contextualize the individual through amenities and consumption-based expressions of shared sensibilities as to what is right, beautiful and genuine. This framework adds to concepts such as neighborhood and workplace by specifying 15 dimensions of the urban scenescape. Like neighborhood and workplace, scenes reduce anomie, but because of their focus on consumption and the use of specific amenities, they are more consistent with today's ethos of contingency, moving beyond traditional ideas of the fundamental power of social, family and occupational background. We introduce a new amenities-focused database to measure and analyze scenes and their dimensions for each of 40,000 U.S. zip codes. We illustrate the framework by applying it to one distinct type of scene, bohemia, and analyze its position in the broader social system. © The University of North Carolina Press.","","","D.

This paper aims to assert that heuristic-based management, for complex systems, a process of free variation, of pairs of models and actions - called organisational strategies, maximizes the chances of improving the system's performance in open environments. Design/methodology/approach: A conception of complex systems are introduced and characterized as open and self-organising systems. Then, the proposal to heuristically use pairs of models and actions, called organisational strategies, to manage social systems based on evolutionary thought is supported. Subsequently, a computational experiment is proposed to show that, even in a simple framework, variation processes are required. Findings: The paper shows that two processes may be required to preserve self-organising systems. This finding indicates that variation and selection processes, related to evolutionary thought, are necessary for managers to deal with complex systems interacting with complex environments. Finally, it is shown that, even in simple computational environments, variation may be required. Research limitations/implications: The paper is the first part of an ongoing research agenda on the subject of heuristic-based management and only refers to variation processes. Originality/value: The paper links complex systems theories to evolutionary thought. It also relates principles of cybernetics to those of game theory. The proposal has been formalized based on these relations, and has been called heuristic-based management. Principles first developed in information theory, organisational cybernetics, and evolutionary thought are used so that a complex system can be effective when interacting with a complex environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate strategy; Cybernetics; Modelling; Problem solving","Cybernetics; Game theory; Information theory; Large scale systems; Models; Problem solving; Complex environments; Computational environments; Computational experiment; Corporate strategies; Design/methodology/approach; Model-based management; Open environment; System's performance; Computation theory","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","0368492X","","","","English","Kybernetes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049492966"

Collective health had a different birth than Public Health: it was founded at the universities, in a moment when it was not anymore the case of organizing a public health system, but, instead, of extending the existing system to all the population of the country. Even its name, Collective Health, evokes the study of a collectivity's health seen as a social system. Therefore, the presence of social sciences e of human sciences in collective health is more than important, it is its very basis, the cement that constitutes and consolidates the field. In spite of the fact that the specificity of this field is given by the social perspective brought in by the word 'collective', it is the word 'health' that is being remembered and used for internal and external classifications of this field. This is the case of funding agencies, in which collective health is classified inside the wide area of health: this position has consequences, in particular the submission to medical logics. As every classification and hierarchy definition, the situation inflicts to collective health sub-areas the same merit criteria used for medical sciences, and may, at the same time, be used to depreciate the knowledge produced by other disciplines.","Collective health; Public health; Social and human sciences in health","","M.

Design/methodology/approach - The STSTE provides the partial derivative of the density of a state-variable with regard to time as a sum of time rates and space-time rates. Time rates describe the dynamics of the system for each space-point irrespectively of the other points, whilst space-time rates describe this evolution as a consequence of the relation of each space-point with a given set of other points of the space. This relation contains integrals over the accessibility domains (sets of space-points with which each space-point is related). Findings - The STSTE is provided for any system of space-coordinates and is compared with the reaction-diffusion models (RD). The reason why it is more convenient to work with the STSTE than with the RD to model complex systems in the context of social systems and ecosystems is indicated. Practical implications - An urban system (the city of Valencia, Spain) is presented as an application; an analytical solution strategy is stated under the simplest hypothesis for computing space-time rates, and a computer program for the situation is developed to obtain numerical solutions. Originality/value - A numerical comparison between the new STSTE model and the RD shows that, the STSTE model produces better results than the reaction diffusion model in validation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cybernetics; Dynamics; Simulation; Systems theory; Time measurement","Application programs; Computation theory; Cybernetics; Differential equations; Diffusion; Diffusion in liquids; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Integrodifferential equations; System theory; Time measurement; Design/methodology/approach; Numerical comparison; Numerical solution; Partial derivatives; Partial integro-differential equations; Reaction-diffusion models; Simulation; State transition equation; Equations of state","A.

In order to address that, the article examines the debate concerning public opinion based on the works of Walter Lippmann (1961), Niklas Luhmann (1997; 2000; 2005), Jürgen Habermas (1991; 1997) and Dirk Baecker (2004), whereas the concept of a digital media matrix is discussed together with the theories of Niels Finnemann (2001), David White (1964) and Kurt Lewin (1947). The relationship between media and public opinion is defined by the historical emergence of forms of coding between communication agents, previously comprising of senders and receivers (peer-to-peer communication), broadcasting (mass communication) and networks of nodes (digital communication). The propagation of public opinion is depicted as a form shaped by a network of nodes, therefore suggesting a diagram for the distribution of messages and opinions in digital networks described as ‘netclustering’. The article offers a synthesis of the literature on public opinion to suggest a model for the viral propagation of messages within networks such as Twitter and Facebook. © 2011 Intellect Ltd Editorial.

This paper explores the nature of innovation systems, conceived as social systems, in searching for their conceptual characteristics. These include the management of the innovation system and the problem of possible conflicts among the objectives attributed to the system and those sought from within the organizations. On the theoretical level this means that a theory of the organization could be useful to support the innovation system theory. In this article, an attempt has been made to illustrate these propositions, through a review of the Basque Government technological policy from the point of view of the university, whose organizational methods have often demonstrated their lack of efficiency in carrying out transfer of economically relevant knowledge. Evidence of the management limitation, and a better understanding of the way the organizations function in the system, could lead us to important technological policy considerations to improve the design and application of a technology policy.","","Basque Region; Spain; innovation; science and technology; technology policy; university sector","","","Carfax Publishing Company","09654313","","","","English","Eur.

The Search Conference is a method which enables the necessary conditions for a set of individuals to engage into a comprehensive process of reflection and design over a specific social system or domain. While preserving its essential characteristics, the Search Conference has been adapted to respond to a Third-World organizational environment. The realization of a ""massive"" conference in a Mexican public university triggered a participative strategic planning process of long-lasting consequences. The university community designed a desired future for the institution which became the guiding force to mobilize it in the agreed-upon direction. They also learned how to plan and carry on projects participatively. Some tangible results are the identification of students' regional demand, with the consequent creation of four new bachelors degrees and two masters degrees; the creation of a program to support those faculty members who would be willing to undertake masters and doctoral studies in outside prestigious universities; the increase in enrollment as a result of combined actions; and the opening of two extension centers off campus to improve the external community's involvement.

Despite the effort expended, the educational results show a strong link with the social origin and economic status of families, i.e., the differences in initial social and cultural capital are not reduced, adjusted or reversed significantly by the regular educational system. The problem lies in the fact that education has very uneven standards among different social strata, so that, even with formal similarities, at bottom, the differences are key and respond to an accumulation of ""advantages"" and ""disadvantages"", according to each case, which finally result in reproduction of intergenerational social inequality, only duly legitimated.This reproductive circle of inequality is the new way by which the problem presents itself, no longer about excluded and included, but about complex new forms of exclusion or inclusion, but equally effective at maintaining the inter-generational differences. The failure of the current design of the social and educational system entails viewing changes that require a change of magnitude in the design of the State, which is estimated to be complex, because, somehow, is to deny itself as a State, to give a step toward a new social pact.","Social and cultural capital; Social inequality; The Chilean educational system","","S.

Production and transferal of knowledge are assumed to be cyclical processes that begin with the individual and which can occur in an integrated and complementary manner within the social system space. Corresponding to this purpose of an explanatory and demonstrative nature, the characteristic elements of certain metaphorical images and the evolutionist biological perspective are transferred to the analysis of the process. The logical-formal research method that is applied is basically abducted inference, complemented by the metaphor, which through a process of transference and analogy allows us to explain the behavior of business sector organizations. A series of explanatory hypothesis are inferred to among which we highlight the distinct manners of thought of organizational actors which contribute to the interpretation and comprehension of specific organizational behavior in relation to knowledge consumption situations.

The data revealed that the children use the programs and services in their own way and the helpers try to make them ""use it right"" by modifying the programs. Thus, each side protects its own view of the situation from the other and this struggle contributes to keep the children and youths on the streets.

This diagnosis merits comparison with other global interpretations of social reality, in particular Niklas Luhmann's systems theory. Such a comparison suggests a possible development of the model that can be derived from Belley's work. It is worth taking into account the differences between organizations, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, functionally differentiated systems such as economy, law, or science. This could enable us to revisit ongoing evolutions with respect to human individuality. The hypothesis is that individuals today act more and more as agents of organizations, and less and less as professionals carrying out functionally differentiated activities, and that they are invited to experience themselves less as individual subjects, than as organization-individuals.","Functional differentiation; Individual; Late modernity; Legal pluralism; Organizations","","P.

Valle Oriente, Mexico; Dunsky H., SolutionsIQ, United States","In an increasingly complex and interconnected global society, the need to redefine 'success' has become an imperative for the survival, sustainability and continued evolution of social systems and their interdependent environments. A wide range of contemporary human institutions-from corporations to governments, schools and universitiesnarrowly focus their structures, functions, and processes (and the strategies that create them) on the attainment of individualistic, and often myopic, conceptions of success. More often than not, success is defined in egocentric and competitive win-lose terms and is primarily measured according to standards of monetary accumulation. Such a definition is at the heart of the currently unsustainable path of human social evolution at the dawn of the 21st century, and its inadequacy represents a serious challenge for contemporary conceptions of capitalism. This paper explores and presents a more comprehensive definition of success: one that embraces financial, social and environmental sustainability as the cornerstones of a holistic approach to value creation and gives rise to conditions for life-affirming dynamics of value exchange to unfold in perpetuity. It is suggested, that this would both rehumanize and revitalize capitalism with a much needed (though not unprecedented) claim to an evolutionary and life-sustaining ethic. Evolutionary systems design (ESD) is described as an approach to the creation of systemic sustainable strategies. ESD is best understood as a heuristic approach that supports and guides the participatory co-creation of sustainable and evolutionary futures. It is grounded in idealized systems design and evolutionary systems theory and embraces theoretical and methodological complementarism from a critical systems perspective. As such, it represents a future-creating form of participatory inquiry that provides a mean by which organizations and communities may achieve successnot in a narrow self-serving sense, but in one that is systemic and evolutionary. Through presentation of ways in which to engage in strategic design conversations, this paper illustrates the potential of ESD as a praxis by which to foster the evolutionary corporation and, in so doing, to guide the evolutionary transformation of business. It is intended as part of the active research of the authors and should be understood as an expression of an ongoing exposition on ESD, treating the issue of strategic design here and leaving that of strategic planning for subsequent presentation. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Blended value; Design; Evolution; Evolutionary corporation; Strategy; Success; Sustainability; Systems thinking","Design; Economics; Electrostatic discharge; Heuristic methods; Industry; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; System theory; Systems analysis; Blended values; Evolution; Strategy; Success; Systems thinking; Electrostatic devices","A.

Diffusion was defined, following Rogers' (1995: 5) seminal work, as 'the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system'. The research method used was industry case studies and the unit of analysis selected was the cluster. Two manufacturing industries were chosen to be investigated, and within each geographic area clusters were identified as the origin of dynamic export growth in the industry. Players in each industrial cluster, as well as other significant actors, were interviewed. Extensive secondary data research was done to study clusters' historical development. Detailed analysis and a comparison of the experiences permitted the extraction of some general conclusions concerning the similarities and differences between the clusters in terms of the adoption and diffusion of exporting. Results showed that the diffusion of exporting in an industrial cluster is quite similar to the dissemination of technical innovation. Social ties were important to facilitate the diffusion of exporting in one of the clusters studied. Also, the role of domestically-owned flagship firms in leading the internationalization process proved to be important in only one of the clusters, while the role of external actors was fully supported in the two industries studied. Finally, a number of support institutions, private and public, interfered in different stages of the internationalization process. In both industries, the federal government had only a late and limited impact on export initiation and development. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Brazil; Diffusion; Exporting; Industrial clusters; Internationalization","Brazil; South America; corporate strategy; economic growth; export; federal system; globalization; industrial development; manufacturing; state role","A. da Rocha; The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; email: angela@coppead.ufrj.br","","","14645114","","","","English","Entrep.

Design/methodology/approach: Designed to illustrate a real-world KM case, this research work used participant observation, on-line interactions and interviews as methodological tools to explore how knowledge management as a discipline has benefited from the use of Web 2.0 technology. Findings: The first part of the article depicts the Most Admired Knowledge City (MAKCi) exercise as a research and learning space networked and tightly connected on-line by common interests of participants. The second part of the article brings further understanding on how networked learning and knowledge creation has been made possible by the use of Web 2.0 tools. It is advanced that higher levels of knowledge co-creation at a global scale can take the shape of networks of practice (NoPs) in knowledge-based development contexts such as the one explored for the MAKCi exercise. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to a three-year recording of practitioners' experiences. Originality/value: Knowledge-based social systems, such as networks of practice (NoPs) are identified as emerging social configurations fostering knowledge-intensive networked learning. NoPs clearly depend on collaboration within networks. Thus, the paper advances that some emerging models of knowledge-intensive networks such as (NoPs) are natural KM vehicles to foster and promote intensive tacit knowledge conversion into explicit scholarly knowledge regardless of geographical location, becoming highly relevant to knowledge-based development (KBD) practitioners. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Information networks; Internet; Knowledge management; Worldwide web","Information services; Internet; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management science; Research; Tools; Design/methodology/approach; Geographical locations; Information networks; Methodological tools; Networks of practices; On-line interactions; Participant observations; Web 2.0 Technologies; World Wide Web","","","","14741032","","","","English","VINE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76449107378"

In this paper, we present the results of a study aimed at identifying retrospectively, in a group of juvenile delinquents, a set of psychosocial risk factors, patterns of anti-social behavior and previous events of risk or psychosocial adversity during infancy. The research has also focused on understanding the relationship between these factors and self-reported psychopathological symptoms. The study comprised a sample of 63 adolescents in the Portuguese Justice System for minors in judicial custody, and data were collected in the south of the country. To collect the required information we used the General Symptom Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory, as well as a questionnaire designed for this study, based on literature review on psychosocial risk factors for antisocial behavior in adolescence, particularly, the typology of psychosocial risk established by Born, Chevalier, and Humblet (1997) and Moffit's developmental taxonomy on adolescents' anti-social behaviour (1993). The results suggest that adolescents whose parents have a clearly conflictual relationship tend to have an index of psychopathological symptoms significantly higher than those whose parents did not present apparent conflicts. However, the report of psychopathology is not significantly higher in people with indicators of negative events in childhood (separation from a parent, absence of a father figure, institutionalization, child abuse, conflict between parents). Results are discussed, limitations of the study are considered and proposals for future research are made.","Anti-social behaviour; Juvenile delinquency; Portuguese juvenile justice system; Psychopathology; Psychosocial risk factors","","I.

This can be perceived in the advances in computer, information and communication technology and the progress made in information science. The use of computers in our daily life, specially in the scope of libraries have pointed out development and possibility to store, to organize and to retrieve information in huge volume and in a rapid way. Communication between users has been supported through links between computers. This interconnectivity, in means of networking is transforming how libraries provide and users seek information. The organization of knowledge is necessary, otherwise retrieval will be difficult for the end-users. They will not obtain the needed information unless they spend much time or they have gained vast experience in searching. In view of this, Information Professionals have to affront the emerging demands of the end-users. Advances in technology and end-users demands are evolving increasingly rapidly. The role of the information professionals has changed dramatically from a ""book-lending"" person to a recognized ""intermediary"" between information and users. This recognition is not in general. In case of Latin American countries this situation is more evident, because of the budget decreasing. The expectation of a library is not only to satisfy users demands, without considering those accomplishment to require essential training, infrastructure and economic resources. Institutions in charge of formal library and information science education are making effort to affront training and skills to face the marketplace. The reluctance to change must be considered by the profession and society, which by means assimilate very slowly those changing profile. In contrast society demands these changes without recognizing the library as an active agent in a social system, neither to support the necessary infrastructure to satisfy users demands. In view of this information professionals got together to discuss issues about their concern of the directions of the profession. They concluded that the future is uncertain. There is a lack of policy and great diversity of opinion among members. Libraries in general are confronting with the idea that this institution is a decreasing stage because the overpromoting of the computer. Users specially in the educational environment have the idea that using a networked environment will immediately solve their information problems. Others have in mind that the cyberspace will substitute the library function and that libraries will be soon disappeared. Libraries in general have been affected not only by these mentioned opinions but also in their budget, which had strongly influenced their possibility to acquire appropriate equipment to satisfy information needs of users and training of the workers.","","","L.O.

It is located at the conceptual level of the social system relationship, being alternatively a resource and a mean to access goods. Under this conception, social capital is transformed into a tool in the living strategy of the individuals to grant them contact to other resources, increase their involvement with organizations and to promote action plans directed to improve their social participation levels. Following this premise, research was conducted in order to quantify and qualify the existence of the social capital in the aloe's chain in the Falcon state, in terms of its nature as an interrelationship promoter among its economical agents that influence its evolution dynamics. The methodology is sustained in the established relationship by the chain agents. The results show that such relationship among individuals related to the aloe's culture is mainly directed by informal institutions developed along time. In the same way, it is highlighted the strong capital reflected in the attitude and proactivity of the members of the chain when the bond oriented to conform a solid base for the connection with the different items related to the aloe's culture is established with the aim of sustaining a scheme of rural development.","Aloe; Falcón; Institutions; Social capital","Aloe; Falconidae","H.

Following that, we will describe the theoretical and normative foundations of contextual systemic intervention. This concept has been presented recently by some authors as an attempt to take Luhmann's sociological theory to the field of social intervention. Finally, we will assess the possibilities for the application of this proposal to social work. The conclusion obtained is that this proposal is insufficient for social work as its normative foundation is too lax.

A questionnaire was sent to students from three graduate programmes in Mexico (two traditional, one distance learning), which examined both personal and environmental factors that have enhanced or undermined students' motivational beliefs. The results show gender differences; female students place higher value on graduate school, while male students hold higher expectations of success.

The central position of these villages in the continent makes them relevant for attempts to reconstruct population movements in South America. In this geographic region, there is particular concern regarding the genetic structure of the Tikúna tribe, formerly designated ""enigmatic"" due to its remarkable degree of intratribal homogeneity and the scarcity of private protein variants. In spite of its large population size and geographic distribution, the Tikúna tribe presents marked genetic and linguistic isolation. All individuals presented indigenous mtDNA haplogroups. An intratribal genetic heterogeneity pattern characterized by two highly homogeneous Tikúna groups that differ considerably from each other was observed. Such a finding was unexpected, since the Tikúna tribe is characterized by a social system that favors intratribal exogamy and patrilocality that would lead to a higher female migration rate and homogenization of the mtDNA gene pool. Demographic explosions and religious events, which significantly changed the sizes and compositions of many Tikúna villages, may be reflected in the genetic results presented here. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Amerindians; Genetic diversity; mtDNA; South America","Brazil; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Population Dynamics; Social Behavior; Social Isolation; mitochondrial DNA; protein; American Indian; article; controlled study; female; gene structure; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; geographic distribution; haplotype; human; linguistics; male; population size; protein variant; sex difference; South America","C.

New frameworks for integrating current knowledge on fission-fusion dynamics emerge from a fundamental rethinking of the term ""fission- fusion"" away from its current general use as a label for a particular modal type of social system (i.e., ""fission-fusion societies""). Specifically, because the degree of spatial and temporal cohesion of group members varies both within and across taxa, any social system can be described in terms of the extent to which it expresses fission-fusion dynamics.

This study examined the life trajectories of older people who lived in poverty throughout their lives and how they evolve towards family integrity or family disconnection. A semi-structured interview on family integrity was administered to 12 participants aged over 64 years old (six of each sex), three in each group were considered as living family integrity situation or disconnection. The main fi ndings suggested that some common circumstances of poverty in people's lives namely: family confl ict and/or distance, domestic violence, (e)migration, multiple severe chronic diseases, informal work, low income, may prevent family integrity and promote family disconnection/alienation. However, participants who were able to reframe negative events as positive tended to achieve family integrity.","Aging; Family relations; Human development; Poverty","","F.D.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests - are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional competencies have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural bottlenecks in the educational and social system. Finally, the lessons learned after more than 15 years of implementing technology in Chilean schools are presented and fully discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Three steps are then taken in order to provide an alternative solution, which tackles the general problem of the relationship between structure and agency. The critical analysis of the notion of 'emergent properties', along with those of 'structure' and 'mechanism', is the groundwork for a discussion of collective causality that substantiates an alternative view which defines social systems as collective subjectivities, including some methodological considerations.

The concepts of metacontingency, interlocking behavioral contingencies (IBCs), cultural milieus, aggregate products, cultural consequences and receiving systems are useful tools for the cultural level of analysis. This paper reviews Glenn and Malott's (2004) perspective on complexity in organizations and suggests complementing it with Norbert Elias' sociological approach, in which increasing complexity in a social system results in (a) increasing conflicts between individual and cultural consequences, (b) greater concurrency of the contingencies that affect the behavior of each member of the group, and (c) the specialization of the functions performed by each participant in the system. We suggest that the more complex a social system is, the more social mediation is necessary to select the IBCs and the more differentiated the cultural consequences from the aggregate product.","Complexity; Cultural selection; Interlocking behavioral contingencies; Metacontingencies","","E.Z.

In Part I, a social systems theory was applied to the analysis of hazardous technology and socio-technical systems, their complex dynamics, and risky dimensions and likelihood of accidents. It identified many of the diverse human risk factors associated with complex technologies and socio-technical systems, thus contributing knowledge toward preventing - or minimizing the likelihood of - accidents or catastrophes. This second part of the article will systematically address the broader issues of risk conceptions, analysis, and management in contemporary society including policy and other practical aspects. The social systems perspective and its derivations are contrasted to such impressionistic conceptions as those of Ulrich Beck. Section 1 of the paper introduces the topic of risk as a discursive concept in contemporary society. Our point of departure is the social system approach introduced in Part I, which is contrasted to that of Ulrich Beck, who eschews systematic theorizing at the same time that he denigrates empirical sociology. The section stresses that contemporary society is not so much threatened by high risks all around (as in Ulrich Beck's ""risk society"") but is more characterized by its developed risk discourses (a great deal owing to Beck himself), risk consciousness, risk theorizing, and risk management. What is truly characteristic of modern society are discretionary powers to determine dimensions, levels, and regulation of risk, that is, choices can be made whether or not to develop a technology, whether or not to not to tightly regulate it, for instance limiting or banning its use or whether or not to allow its widespread application, and under what conditions. Section 2 provides a brief review of our social systems framework, actor-system-dialectics (ASD) theory. Section 3 treats risk and risk analysis in a systems perspective, emphasizing the limitations of risk assessment and the risk management of complex, hazardous systems. Section 4 considers several principles which may serve to guide policy-making and regulation with respect to the hazards and risks of complex technologies and socio-technical systems.","Accident; Actor-system dialectics; Complexity; Regulation; Risk; Risky system; Socio-technical system; Technology","","","","","08736529","","","","English","Sociol.

Nevertheless, this historical presence has been irregular: there were stages of complete invisibility and phases in which the event has had a bit more of prominence. In the 70s and 80s of the 20th century the analysts claimed the event as a response to the structuralism, which monopolized the research of the central decades of that century. It was a theoretical claim and to a lesser extent, empiricist, in search of an exit to the closed social systems described by structuralism. This article proposes to recover this theoretical contribution. However, modern societies seem to be different from solidly structured societies described in the 20th century. We wonder if the event is the same. That is to say, if the event is a way of change in societies who live in a permanent change. It will test, then, the current validity of those reflections on the event and, where appropriate, this theory will be updated according to a new contemporary reality.","Contemporary event; Event; Event theory; Social theory","","J.

In this sense, it is a tool that reduces the uncertainties of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) since it does not depend exclusively on the value assessments of the evaluator, but rather is based on the environmental state indicators of the site where the projects or activities are being carried out. The concept of vulnerability thus reduces the possibility that evaluators will subjectively interpret results, and be influenced by outside interests and pressures during projects. However, up until now, EIA has been hindered by a lack of effective methods. This research study analyzes the concept of vulnerability, defines Vulnerability Importance and proposes its inclusion in qualitative EIA methodology. The method used to quantify Vulnerability Importance is based on a set of environmental factors and indicators that provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental state.

Disasters have implications on the social order, and the social order can collaborate to produce disasters. The social disruption deriving from inequality situations influences the response to disaster events, including political and economic factors that increase vulnerability. This paper analyzes the institutional discourse and the civil defense practices in the Brazilian context. First of all, it describes the main approaches of the sociology of disasters: the minimal consensus, the polarity and dichotomy, and shows one approach about the relationship between unequal development, vulnerability and civil defense planning. The present situation in Brazilian cities is of restriction to land access and it results in an increase in disasters. If changes do not occur in State's planning, with the adoption of new strategies explicitly formulated to break up the ideological point of view that subjects the poor groups, the disasters will continue happening. In the present structural dimension of planning, the Brazilian civil defense system classifies the vulnerable groups without considering social complexity. Disasters do not completely destroy the existing social systems, but they are capable of maintaining continuous processes of social indifference. Thus, the paper concludes by emphasizing the development of a participatory agenda in civil defense planning and decision-making processes.","Civil defense; Sociology of disasters; Vulnerability","","N.

The ballet field can be considered as a set of cultural institutions where many people contribute to the creation of professional dancers. The main artistic merit for a ballet dancer is not just to represent his country, but also to be considered as a revolutionary. A pyramidal system of selection, formation and professional performance of dancers structures the ballet field. The Darwinist principle of natural selection rules the essential social practices of exclusion/inclusion into the pyramidal system. The qualifying test of physical capacity, the middle level test during the studies and the final audition to be accepted by the Cuban National Ballet Company, are the social practices that determine the level of success of a dancer inside.

Howler monkeys provide a good model for studying sexual selection due to differences in social systems between related species. Here, we examine data from the sister howler monkey species Alouatta palliata and A. pigra inhabiting southeastern Mexico and northern Guatemala. We use a resampling approach to analyze differences in sexual dimorphism of body and canine size. In addition, we compare testes size as a way of gauging the intensity of sperm competition in both species. Morphometric data were collected from wild-caught individuals, including body mass and length, and dental data were obtained from casts from wild individuals and from museum specimens. Although A. pigra individuals are larger than their A. palliata counterparts, we find that both species exhibit similar levels of sexual dimorphism for all of the variables considered. Testicular volume results indicate that A. palliata male testes are on average twice as large as those of A. pigra males, suggesting more intense sperm competition in the former species. Our study shows that A. pigra is not highly sexually dimorphic as was once thought, and testes size differences suggest the need for a clearer understanding of howler monkey social systems.

It distinguishes between a first, second and third generation of regional policies over a period of almost half-a-century. From a functionalist perspective, as Talcott Parsons might say, any socioeconomic system seeks to achieve three transcendent, irrevocable, and long-term objectives. Firstly, to systematically increase production capacity of goods and services. Secondly, to obtain a certain social stability that facilitates savings and investments, a condition also necessary in order to achieve the first objective. The goal of maintaining a social system free of recurrent extreme stress, in order to facilitate savings and investment, is placed in jeopardy by the growing inequality of the distribution pattern of the economic growth process. According to this latter position, the lack of development of Latin American countries was mainly due to a set of structural barriers that prevented these countries from following the path of progress, already trodden by the industrialized nations.","","Latin America; economic growth; historical perspective; investment; policy implementation; regional policy; savings; socioeconomic conditions; twentieth century; twenty first century","","","","02506505","","","","English","Reg.

The investigations have revealed a large site, over 2 km in length. Habitation areas similar to those identified at other sites in the region were found. Cemetery areas with low status burials contrast with high status interments at the adjacent site of Panteón de La Reina. In addition, a large complex of monumental architecture that is unlike anything found in the area for the time period (ca. a.c. 900-1500) has been identified. Concentrated deposits of fancy ceramics, including many examples of wares imported from the Atlantic Watershed and Central Valley regions, suggest that Rivas was a major node in long distance exchange systems. These various data suggest that the social system of the Rivas site was highly ranked or stratified and that the site itself was of great significance in regional and inter-regional cultural dynamics. © 1995 Maney Publishing.","","","","","","00934690","","","","English","J.

When testing the general model, results from multiple regression analyses on 94 males and 77 females revealed that values of parents, family, peers, opportunity set and teachers strongly influenced the process of becoming involved in sport. Stepwise regressions revealed that the model was a better predictor of female sport involvement, with opportunity set and female siblings providing the strongest influence. In the case of males, parents' values, fathers and brothers proved to be the strongest contributing factors. Although not dissimilar to findings on North American children, results from this study suggest that there may be some unique features of sport socialization with respect to Brazilian children.

From the commerce of the East Mediterranean to Mesopotamia, through and within the Anatolia peninsula to the Indus Valley and the Yellow River. Greek city states made a substantial shift in city autonomy that marked their role thereafter. City rivalry arose again and was noticeable by the eleventh century, first through the development of Mediterranean sea ports and thereafter by inland and continental crossroads, whose strength lasted for centuries during medieval times, where strategic points in commercial axes became large urban settlements. The birth of the modern state forced them to lose their political notoriety but not their economic importance, mainly due to the fact that the dominant economic system, commercial and then industrial and financial capitalism, used the cities as their economic base and image of the new social system. Moreover, rapid changes in the social division of labour were taking place mainly in the flourishing agglomerations. Already at the beginning of the century—and especially after the October Revolution—and for decades, main capital cities were portrayed as examples to follow in a world divided by political and economic blocks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Her case demonstrates that the social transmission of traditional beliefs and symbols is not in itself enough to ensure the commitment of shaman/healers who must also internalize their cultural beliefs and attach personal meaning to them through their dreams, visions, and ritual practices. If this does not occur, as in Fresia's case, individuality emerges and may contradict ideal cultural representations even in contexts such as that of the Mapuche where the concept of the person is inextricably bound up with one's role in the social system.

Based on his scientific work in the Mediterranean, he suggests that economic development, biological diversity and the quality of human life are three aspects which provide the support for human life, but we are presently in danger of forgetting the last two. He sees biodiversity not simplistically as a natural state to be preserved, but as a dynamic and fluid response to the different elements competing in the biosystem. In achieving a better quality of life, humanity has to be careful not to erode resources but has to evolve a new and sensitive ethical and social systems which allows us to work with not against nature.","","","","","","10116370","","","","English","Development (London)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0008050798"

Today, the numerous development actions, missions and inquiries all come to the same conclusion: development is checked and even stopped by mental structures, ideological factors, religious beliefs. This empirical finding bears out a long series of theoretical studies. For sociologists and eco nomists alike, from Weber to Tawney and Sombart, never stopped to investigate the influence of religious factors in the development of industrial civilization. However, the question remains: among all the religions found in a given milieu, which one is actually a check or a prime-mover of development ? Which one encourages sub missiveness to a given social set up ? Is this submissiveness really due to religion, or rather to the current social system ? All these problems are approached in this book from the Haitian point of view and on the documentary basis of the content analysis of a religious text-book. © 1970, Sage Publications.
