abstract = {Combined use of machine learning and large data allows us to analyze data and find explanatory models that would not be possible with traditional techniques, which is basic within the principles of symmetry. The present study focuses on the analysis of the scientific production and performance of the Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) concepts. A bibliometric methodology of scientific mapping has been used, based on processes of estimation, quantification, analytical tracking, and evaluation of scientific research. A total of 4240 scientific publications from theWeb of Science (WoS) have been analyzed. Our results show a constant and ascending evolution of the scientific production on MLBD, 2018 and 2019 being the most productive years. The productions are mainly in English language. The topics are variable in the different periods analyzed, where "machine-learning" is the one that shows the greatest bibliometric indicators, it is found in most of motor topics and is the one that offers the greatest line of continuity between the different periods. It can be concluded that research on MLBD is of interest and relevance to the scientific community, which focuses its studies on the branch of machine-learning.},

abstract = {The explosive growing number of data from mobile devices, social media, Internet of Things and other applications has highlighted the emergence of big data. This paper aims to determine the worldwide research trends on the field of big data and its most relevant research areas. A bibliometric approach was performed to analyse a total of 6572 papers including 28 highly cited papers and only papers that were published in the Web of ScienceTM Core Collection database from 1980 to 19 March 2015 were selected. The results were refined by all relevant Web of Science categories to computer science, and then the bibliometric information for all the papers was obtained. Microsoft Excel version 2013 was used for analyzing the general concentration, dispersion and movement of the pool of data from the papers. The t test and ANOVA were used to prove the hypothesis statistically and characterize the relationship among the variables. A comprehensive analysis of the publication trends is provided by document type and language, year of publication, contribution of countries, analysis of journals, analysis of research areas, analysis of web of science categories, analysis of authors, analysis of author keyword and keyword plus. In addition, the novelty of this study is that it provides a formula from multi-regression analysis for citation analysis based on the number of authors, number of pages and number of references.},

The objective of the work is to find the most cited articles in the given time frame, the citation trends, the authorship trends as well as the trends of research work in the related area. The analysis shows that over 50{\%} of publications do not receive any citations, and the average number of citations per publication is 3.17. It is also observed that single authorship of research publications has declined over the time. The analysis reveals the pioneering role played by the USA in advancing the research in big data, which has lately been taken over by China, and the large-scale usage of big data analytics in various domains of science.},

In response to this emerging phenomenon, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of big data. Design/methodology/approach: A bibliometric method was used to analyze the articles obtained from the Scopus database published between 2013 and 2018. A sample size of 4,070 articles was evaluated using SciVal metrics. Findings: The analysis revealed an array of interesting findings as follows: the number of publications related to big data increased steadily over the past six years, though the rate of increase has slowed since 2014; the scope of big data research is quite broad in regards to both research domains and countries; despite a large volume of publications, the overall performance of big data research is not well presented as measured by the field-weighted citation impact metric; collaboration between different institutions, particularly in the form of international collaboration and academic–corporate collaboration, has played an important role in improving the performance of big data research. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide a holistic view of the big data research. The insights obtained from the analysis are instrumental for both academics and practitioners.},

In this article, we review academic literature associated with “Big Data” and “Business Intelligence” to explore the development and research trends. We use bibliometric methods to analyze publications from 1990 to 2017 in journals indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts {\&} Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). We map the time trend, disciplinary distribution, high-frequency keywords to show emerging topics. The findings indicate that Computer Science and management information systems are two core disciplines that drive research associated with Big Data and Business Intelligence. “Data mining” “social media” and “information system” are high frequency keywords, but “cloud computing” “data warehouse” and “knowledge management” are more emphasized after 2016.},

We observe a surge in BD publications along a gradual increase in DS publications. Interestingly, a new publications course emerges combining the BD and DS concepts. We evaluate the three literature streams using various bibliometric indicators including research areas and their origin, central journals, the countries producing and funding research and startup organizations, citation dynamics, dispersion and author commitment. We find that BD and DS have differing academic origin and different leading publications. Of the two terms, BD is more salient, possibly catalyzed by the strong acceptance of the pre-coordinated term by the research community, intensive citation activity, and also, we observe, by generous funding from Chinese sources. Overall, DS literature serves as a theory-base for BD publications.},

Exploring the technological evolution of big data research is an effective way to enhance technology management and create value for research and development strategies for both government and industry. This paper uses a learning-enhanced bibliometric study to discover interactions in big data research by detecting and visualizing its evolutionary pathways. Concentrating on a set of 5840 articles derived from Web of Science covering the period between 2000 and 2015, text mining and bibliometric techniques are combined to profile the hotspots in big data research and its core constituents. A learning process is used to enhance the ability to identify the interactive relationships between topics in sequential time slices, revealing technological evolution and death. The outputs include a landscape of interactions within big data research from 2000 to 2015 with a detailed map of the evolutionary pathways of specific technologies. Empirical insights for related studies in science policy, innovation management, and entrepreneurship are also provided.},

We evaluate 286 articles published in the past 10 years and identify the top contributing authors, countries and key research topics. Furthermore, we obtain and compare the most influential works based on citations and PageRank. Finally, we identify and propose six research clusters in which scholars could be encouraged to expand Big Data research in SCM. We contribute to the literature on Big Data by discussing the challenges of current research, but more importantly, by identifying and proposing these six research clusters and future research directions. Finally, we offer to managers different schools of thought to enable them to harness the benefits from using Big Data and analytics for SCM in their everyday work.},

abstract = {In an Information technology world, the ability to effectively process massive datasets has become integral to a broad range of scientific and other academic disciplines. We are living in an era of data deluge and as a result, the term 'Big Data' is appearing in many contexts. It ranges from meteorology, genomics, complex physics simulations, biological and environmental research, finance and business to healthcare. Big Data refers to data streams of higher velocity and higher variety. The infrastructure required to support the acquisition of Big Data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and in executing short, simple queries. To be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed environment; and support flexible, dynamic data structures. Data processing is considerably more challenging than simply locating, identifying, understanding, and citing data. For effective large-scale analysis all of this has to happen in a completely automated manner. This requires differences in data structure and semantics to be expressed in forms that are computer understandable, and then 'robotically' resolvable. There is a strong body of work in data integration, mapping and transformations. However, considerable additional work is required to achieve automated error-free difference resolution. This paper proposes a framework on recent research for the Data Mining using Big Data.},

This article deconstructs the ideological grounds of datafication. Datafication is rooted in problematic ontological and epistemological claims. As part of a larger social media logic, it shows characteristics of a widespread secular belief. Dataism, as this conviction is called, is so successful because masses of people -- naively or unwittingly -- trust their personal information to corporate platforms. The notion of trust becomes more problematic because people's faith is extended to other public institutions (e.g. academic research and law enforcement) that handle their (meta)data. The interlocking of government, business and academia in the adaptation of this ideology makes the authors want to look more critically at the entire ecosystem of connective media.

abstract = {In an Information technology world, the ability to effectively process massive datasets has become integral to a broad range of scientific and other academic disciplines. We are living in an era of data deluge and as a result, the term 'Big Data' is appearing in many contexts. It ranges from meteorology, genomics, complex physics simulations, biological and environmental research, finance and business to healthcare. Big Data refers to data streams of higher velocity and higher variety. The infrastructure required to support the acquisition of Big Data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and in executing short, simple queries. To be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed environment; and support flexible, dynamic data structures. Data processing is considerably more challenging than simply locating, identifying, understanding, and citing data. For effective large-scale analysis all of this has to happen in a completely automated manner. This requires differences in data structure and semantics to be expressed in forms that are computer understandable, and then 'robotically' resolvable. There is a strong body of work in data integration, mapping and transformations. However, considerable additional work is required to achieve automated error-free difference resolution. This paper proposes a framework on recent research for the Data Mining using Big Data.},

Anecdotally we understand that an individual might be listed as an author on a particular publication for numerous reasons other than research collaboration. Yet because of the accessibility and other advantages of bibliometric data, co-authorship is continuously used as a proxy for research collaboration. In this study, a national (US) sample of academic researchers was asked about their relationships with their closest research collaborators—some with whom respondents reported having co-authored and some with whom respondents reported not co-authoring. The results suggest there are numerous dimensions of co-authorship, the most influential of which is informal and relational and with little (directly) to do with intellectual and/or other resource contributions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. Generally we advise academics and evaluators interested in tracking co-authorship as a proxy for collaboration to collect additional data beyond those available from popular bibliometric resources because such information means better-informed modeling and better-informed policy and management decision making.},

The nature and magnitude of collaboration vary from one discipline to another, and depend upon such factors as the nature of the research problem, the research environ ment, and demographic factors. Earlier studies have shown a high degree of correlation between collaboration and research productivity, and between collaboration and financial support for research. The extent of collaboration cannot be easily determined by traditional methods of survey and observation. Bibliometric methods offer a convenient and non-reactive tool for studying collaboration in research. In this paper, several types of collaboration have been identified, and earlier research on collaboration has been reviewed.

Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as {\^{a}}€{\oe} modularity{\^{a}}€ over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a centrality measure that identifies vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

In this paper, we outline our approach to combining multiple qualitative data sets and explain why working with a corpus of ‘big qual' data is a worthwhile endeavour. We present a new approach that iteratively combines recursive surface thematic mapping and in-depth interpretive work. Our breadth-and-depth method involves a series of steps: (1) surveying archived data sets to create a new assemblage of data; (2) recursive surface thematic mapping in dialogue with (3) preliminary ‘test pit' analysis, remapping and repetition of preliminary analysis; and (4) in-depth analysis of the type that is familiar to most qualitative researchers. In so doing, we show how qualitative researchers can conduct ‘big qual' analysis while retaining the distinctive order of knowledge about social processes that is the hallmark of rigorous qualitative research, with its integrity of attention to nuanced context and detail.},

In this methodological essay, we first distinguish big data from big qual. We define big qual as data sets containing either primary or secondary qualitative data from at least 100 participants analyzed by teams of researchers, often funded by a government agency or private foundation, conducted either as a stand-alone project or in conjunction with a large quantitative study. We then present a broad debate about the extent to which big qual may be transforming some forms of qualitative inquiry. We present three questions, which examine the extent to which large qualitative data sets offer both constraints and opportunities for innovation related to funded research, sampling strategies, team-based analysis, and computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). The debate is framed by four related trends to which we attribute the rise of big qual: the rise of big quantitative data, the growing legitimacy of qualitative and mixed methods work in the research community, technological advances in CAQDAS, and the willingness of government and private foundations to fund large qualitative projects.},

In their production, visualizers draw on historical antecedents which define what constitutes a good visualization. In their reception, audiences similarly draw on experiences with visualizations and other visual forms to categorize them as good or bad. While there are often sound reasons for such assessments, the gendered dimensions of judgments of cultural artifacts like data visualizations cannot be ignored. In this article, we highlight how definitions of visualizations as bad are sometimes gendered. In turn, this gendered derision is often entangled with legitimate criticisms of poor visualization execution, making it hard to see and so normalized. This, we argue, is a form of what Gill calls flexible sexism, and it is why there is a need not just for feminist critiques of big data but for feminist data studies-that is, feminists doing big data and data visualization.},

Doing so is crucial as these countries not only comprise some of the world's largest populations, but have also demonstrated their initiative in national and international promotion of big data politics. Drawing on a content analysis of strategic and legal documents discussing the use of big data, we identify potential areas for big data cooperation among the BICs by determining the compatibility of national policy visions. Three visions are apparent: data as a force for political liberation or repression, for improving public services and for facilitating development. Successful BIC cooperation is likely related to the latter two, but less probable for the liberation/repression vision. We conclude by identifying the implications of BIC engagement with big data for the Global South more broadly.},

@article{Medeiros2020,
abstract = {Purpose: In the age of analytical competition, business models and gaining competitive advantage (CA) are directly related to organizations' data strategy. Incorporating data strategy enables the organization to unlock the potential value of big data analytics. Therefore, this study aims to analyze how data strategy affects the achievement of CA. Design/methodology/approach: Through survey research, data were collected from 103 respondents. Model testing and evaluation, partial least squares structural equation modeling and analysis of mediating effects were performed. Findings: The supported hypotheses confirm the direct effects between the defensive and offensive positioning of the data strategy on CA, as well as the mediating effect of the offensive data strategy (ODS). Originality/value: This study is groundbreaking in terms of empirically analyzing how defensive data strategy (DDS) or ODS affects CA. In conclusion, to extract value from their data, organizations need to establish their data strategy based on their strategic positioning, the potential of their resources and their analytical capabilities. Research implications: The defensive and offensive positioning of the data strategy are closely related to each other and both, in isolation, directly and positively, impact CA. It is also noted that the role of defensive positioning is to strengthen the offensive positioning of the data strategy, which in turn, plays a central role in achieving CA. Practical implications: The results can assist managers in effectively incorporating analytical resources and capabilities, as well as helping them understand the dynamics and advantages of data strategy, so they can drive strategic objectives according to the organization's positioning. Originality/value: This study is groundbreaking in terms of empirically analyzing how DDS or ODS affects CA.

abstract = {Size is the first, and at times, the only dimension that leaps out at the mention of big data. This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95{\%} of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.},

abstract = {This paper investigates political homophily on Twitter. Using a combination of machine learning and social network analysis we classify users as Democrats or as Republicans based on the political content shared. We then investigate political homophily both in the network of reciprocated and nonreciprocated ties. We find that structures of political homophily differ strongly between Democrats and Republicans. In general, Democrats exhibit higher levels of political homophily. But Republicans who follow official Republican accounts exhibit higher levels of homophily than Democrats. In addition, levels of homophily are higher in the network of reciprocated followers than in the nonreciprocated network. We suggest that research on political homophily on the Internet should take the political culture and practices of users seriously. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Communication Association.},

abstract = {The context in which service is delivered and experienced has, in many respects, fundamentally changed. For instance, advances in technology, especially information technology, are leading to a proliferation of revolutionary services and changing how customers serve themselves before, during, and after purchase. To understand this changing landscape, the authors engaged in an international and interdisciplinary research effort to identify research priorities that have the potential to advance the service field and benefit customers, organizations, and society. The priority-setting process was informed by roundtable discussions with researchers affiliated with service research centers and networks located around the world and resulted in the following 12 service research priorities:stimulating service innovation,facilitating servitization, service infusion, and solutions,understanding organization and employee issues relevant to successful service,developing service networks and systems,leveraging service design,using big data to advance service,understanding value creation,enhancing the service experience,improving well-being through transformative service,measuring and optimizing service performance and impact,understanding service in a global context, andleveraging technology to advance service. For each priority, the authors identified important specific service topics and related research questions. Then, through an online survey, service researchers assessed the subtopics' perceived importance and the service field's extant knowledge about them. Although all the priorities and related topics were deemed important, the results show that topics related to transformative service and measuring and optimizing service performance are particularly important for advancing the service field along with big data, which had the largest gap between importance and current knowledge of the field. The authors present key challenges that should be addressed to move the field forward and conclude with a discussion of the need for additional interdisciplinary research.},

I argue that this sort of data are largely being streamed from sensors, and this represents a sea change in the kinds of data that we have about what happens where and when in cities. I describe how the growth of big data is shifting the emphasis from longer term strategic planning to short-term thinking about how cities function and can be managed, although with the possibility that over much longer periods of time, this kind of big data will become a source for information about every time horizon. By way of conclusion, I illustrate the need for new theory and analysis with respect to 6 months of smart travel card data of individual trips on Greater London's public transport systems. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

@article{Hashem2016,
abstract = {The expansion of big data and the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have played an important role in the feasibility of smart city initiatives. Big data offer the potential for cities to obtain valuable insights from a large amount of data collected through various sources, and the IoT allows the integration of sensors, radio-frequency identification, and Bluetooth in the real-world environment using highly networked services. The combination of the IoT and big data is an unexplored research area that has brought new and interesting challenges for achieving the goal of future smart cities. These new challenges focus primarily on problems related to business and technology that enable cities to actualize the vision, principles, and requirements of the applications of smart cities by realizing the main smart environment characteristics. In this paper, we describe the state-of-the-art communication technologies and smart-based applications used within the context of smart cities. The visions of big data analytics to support smart cities are discussed by focusing on how big data can fundamentally change urban populations at different levels. Moreover, a future business model of big data for smart cities is proposed, and the business and technological research challenges are identified. This study can serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for the future progress and development of smart cities in the context of big data.},

@article{Zuboff2015,
abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, 'surveillance capitalism,' and considers its implications for 'information civilization.' The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: 'data extraction and analysis,' 'new contractual forms due to better monitoring,' 'personalization and customization,' and 'continuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: 'Big Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},

abstract = {Recent advances in technology and the increasing volumes of data that they enable have led to a wave of scholarly and popular attention to big data. While big data is often heralded for its ability to provide insight, the data, its analysis, and its outcomes are not evenly distributed. Currently, scholarship on big data is extending past work on the digital divide, theorizing a new big data divide. While this work most directly addresses the issues of ownership and access to big data, some work extends the divide to issues relating to skill and use. This extension opens up new complications relating to identity, social sorting, use, agency, and global development that are inextricably related to the issues above and to the study of big data. These issues go beyond the simple language of the digital divide extending inquiries into the realm of digital inequalities more generally. Any work on big data and the big data divide needs to engage with a more broad‐based notion of digital inequalities to be better equipped to handle the complex issues above, as well as the material, democratic, and identity problems that big data bring about.},

abstract = {There are growing discontinuities between the research practices of data science and established tools of research ethics regulation. Some of the core commitments of existing research ethics regulations, such as the distinction between research and practice, cannot be cleanly exported from biomedical research to data science research. Such discontinuities have led some data science practitioners and researchers to move toward rejecting ethics regulations outright. These shifts occur at the same time as a proposal for major revisions to the Common Rule—the primary regulation governing human-subjects research in the USA—is under consideration for the first time in decades. We contextualize these revisions in long-running complaints about regulation of social science research and argue data science should be understood as continuous with social sciences in this regard. The proposed regulations are more flexible and scalable to the methods of non-biomedical research, yet problematically largely exclude data science methods from human-subjects regulation, particularly uses of public datasets. The ethical frameworks for Big Data research are highly contested and in flux, and the potential harms of data science research are unpredictable. We examine several contentious cases of research harms in data science, including the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion study and the 2016 use of geographical data techniques to identify the pseudonymous artist Banksy. To address disputes about application of human-subjects research ethics in data science, critical data studies should offer a historically nuanced theory of “data subjectivity” responsive to the epistemic methods, harms and benefits of data science and commerce.},

@article{Leonelli2016,
abstract = {The distributed and global nature of data science creates challenges for evaluating the quality, import and potential impact of the data and knowledge claims being produced. This has significant consequences for the management and oversight of responsibilities and accountabilities in data science. In particular, it makes it difficult to determine who is responsible for what output, and how such responsibilities relate to each other; what 'participation' means and which accountabilities it involves, with regard to data ownership, donation and sharing as well as data analysis, re-use and authorship; and whether the trust placed on automated tools for data mining and interpretation is warranted (especially as data processing strategies and tools are often developed separately from the situations of data use where ethical concerns typically emerge). To address these challenges, this paper advocates a participative, reflexive management of data practices. Regulatory structures should encourage data scientists to examine the historical lineages and ethical implications of their work at regular intervals. They should also foster awareness of the multitude of skills and perspectives involved in data science, highlighting how each perspective is partial and in need of confrontation with others. This approach has the potential to improve not only the ethical oversight for data science initiatives, but also the quality and reliability of research outputs.

It was only towards the very end of 2010 that the term began to register, just ahead of an explosion of interest from 2011 onwards. In this commentary we take the opportunity to reflect back on the claims we made in that original paper in light of more recent discussions about the social scientific implications of the inundation of digital data. Did our paper, with its emphasis on the emergence of, what we termed, ‘social transac- tional data' and ‘digital byproduct data' prefigure contemporary debates that now form the basis and rationale for this excellent new journal? Or was the paper more concerned with broader methodological, theoretical and political debates that have somehow been lost in all of the loud babble that has come to surround Big Data. Using recent work on the BBC Great British Class Survey as an example this brief paper offers a reflexive and critical reflection on what has become – much to the surprise of its authors – one of the most cited papers in the discipline of sociology in the last decade.},
